He is the youngest State Alchemist ever to be recognized by the Amestris State Military, having received the title at the age of 12. Ed's primary motivation throughout the series is to return his younger brother, Alphonse, to his original body, which was lost in a failed human transmutation. Edward, despite his occasional bouts of immaturity, is a selfless boy who gains a reputation as a \"hero of the people\" throughout his youth. Notably, he doesn't seem concerned about returning his own arm and leg, instead focusing entirely on Al's suffering.\n\nEdward is small for his age, standing at only 149 cm (4'11\"), however his body is that of an experienced martial artist, with noticeable muscles and a wealth of agility. Although he lacks both his right arm and left leg, Ed's ability to fight is not impaired, and is in fact improved, as he will often use alchemy to cause his metal arm to partly transform into a blade or shield. His heavy automail limbs are considered by him to be the very best in Amestris. They were made by his childhood friend, Winry Rockbell, and she is constantly working on them. He is able to think quickly, even in desperate situations, though can still be frightened into paralysis. These qualities, combined with his alchemical powers and physical strength, make him a formidable fighter.",

She expands their training with a regimen of philosophy, martial arts, and living off the land. Her methods are derived from her own alchemy training: in the manga and second anime, she was forced to survive in the northern region surrounding Briggs Fortress for a month (although it turns out she succeeded by stealing supplies from the northern fortress), whereas in the first anime she was taught by Dante. She thinks of the Elrics as her own sons, and although she severs her student-teacher ties with them after learning of their attempts with human transmutation (and similarly Ed's joining the State Military), she continues to do all she can to help them. She can be quite violent when punishing or sparring with the Elric brothers, so they tend to be deathly afraid of her. Her claim of \"I'm a housewife!\" while confronting Greed was a favorite scene of Arakawa's to draw.  Izumi and her husband Sig Curtis (シグ・カーティス, Shigu Kātisu) were expecting a child years before the start of the series; however, their son was stillborn. Izumi tried and failed to revive the child through human transmutation (an act that created Wrath in the first anime). The failed attempt took some of her internal organs, resulting in infertility, and causing her to periodically cough up blood. Izumi gained the ability to use alchemy without a transmutation circle after seeing the \"truth.\"  In the manga, Izumi attracts the attention of the State Military for surviving the failed human transmutation. As she and her husband travel around Amestris in order to avoid the military, they eventually meet Ed and Al's father Hohenheim. He rearranges her insides to ease the blood flow, and persuades her to help collaborate in bringing down the State Military.",

      "description": "Roy Mustang is a state alchemist and officer in the Amestrian state military. A hero of the Ishval Civil War and [Edward Elric](https://anilist.co/character/11/Edward-Elric)’s superior officer, Mustang is a remarkably capable commander who plans to become the next Führer of Amestris.\n\nMustang is a clean-shaven young man with dark eyes. His dark hair is casually unkempt, falling over his eyes; in more formal or somber situations, however, he is known to wear it neatly slicked back. A great fan of classy attire, Mustang is rarely seen out of uniform (and even while in uniform will often don other accouterments, such as a long, black overcoat and white formal-wear gloves), but when dressed in civilian clothes, he appears rather partial to the three-piece suit and black tie (frequently coupled with classic scarves, polished dress shoes, and the aforementioned overcoat and gloves). He tends toward dark or neutral colors in his dress, such as dark blue, brown, and black tempered with minimal white.\n\n~!After the events of his fight with [Lust](https://anilist.co/character/650/Lust), Mustang carries a faint scar on the back of his right hand in the shape of the flame alchemy transmutation circle. He also carries a large burn wound on his left side, lower back, and abdomen from the same event.!~\n\nOn the surface, Mustang is presented as a shallow, self-absorbed, and incorrigible womanizer who is infamous among many of his colleagues and subordinates alike for the selfish and narcissistic aura he gives off. Easily as arrogant as Edward Elric, Mustang is one to act ostentatiously and appears to act mostly out of self-interest rather than any sort of philanthropy. He comes off to most as a sort of cocky layabout, shirking most of his duties and delegating his paperwork to subordinates while sitting idly at his desk with an amused smile on his face as he procrastinates, but is quick to take action when it appears that there is glory and military notoriety to be gained. Mustang is expertly manipulative and prone to think several steps ahead of those around him, giving him a remarkable talent for making subordinates act exactly as he wishes despite appearing not to have had a hand in their decisions - all traits which make the fact that he has managed to attain the lofty rank of colonel at such a young age a matter of public gossip.\n\nMustang also has a reputation of being a shameless flirt, and it's rumored that he spends much of his time cavorting about town with various women and wooing several of the servicewomen with his abundant charm, good looks, and charisma. This adds another facet to his unpopularity among the enlisted men, many of whom fear having sweethearts and crushes romanced away from them by his hand. He has, however, never actually been shown to be on a serious date with any woman; any flirtatious interactions he had with women seemed to be nothing more than a cover to discretely pass along information.\n\nAt the core, Mustang is a remarkably devoted commander whose primary focus and personal duty is to his friends and subordinates. Though he hides it well behind a veil of cynicism and self-importance, Mustang is a man who cares deeply about the people who trust and support him and goes to great lengths to ensure their safety and well-being, even at the risk of his own. As a man with considerable power, Mustang considers himself a protector to those without and acts accordingly, earning the staunch loyalty of his most trusted compatriots.\n\nOrphaned at a young age, Mustang was adopted by his father's younger sister, who brought him up intending to make him into a fine gentleman. Presumably, in his teens, he discovered an affinity for alchemy and took basic instruction in the craft from master alchemist [Berthold Hawkeye](https://anilist.co/character/75922/Berthold-Hawkeye) in the hopes of becoming a source of strength and knowledge for the people of Amestris. However, faced with the increasing frequency of border wars, he left his teacher's charge and enrolled in the state military academy with the intent of becoming a state alchemist and devoting himself to the protection of citizens caught in the crossfire of international struggles. While at the military academy, he became friends with fellow cadet [Maes Hughes](https://anilist.co/character/69/Maes-Hughes), with whom he often discussed his idealistic dreams for the future of the country.\n\n~![Pride](https://anilist.co/character/10982/Selim-Bradley) uses the Gold-Toothed Doctor to open the Gate of Truth, forcing Mustang into it. What happens while Mustang is at the gate is unclear, but as he leaves, he is transported to the room where Edward Elric, [Alphonse Elric](https://anilist.co/character/12/Alphonse-Elric), and [Izumi Curtis](https://anilist.co/character/67/Izumi-Curtis) were taken before. Elric tries to talk to him, and Mustang replies that he cannot see; [Truth](https://anilist.co/character/33816/Truth) has taken his sight as the price of looking inside the gate, either to \"deprive the man who had a grand vision to save his country from his eyesight, denying him to see what his beloved nation will become\". as Homunculus claims it to be, or merely to give a price for seeing the Truth.\n\nMustang's blindness is later cured with a Philosopher's Stone at the end of the series. In [Brotherhood](https://anilist.co/anime/5114/Fullmetal-Alchemist-Brotherhood/), the stone is used to heal Havoc's paralysis before curing his blindness.!~\n\n(Source: Fullmetal Alchemist Wiki, edited)",

He is able to rearrange the carbon in his body to make his skin as hard as diamond, thus making himself almost impossible to injure. As his name implies he is a very avaricious character, who likes living in luxury, surrounded by powerful minions and beautiful women. Despite his generally greedy nature, he’s shown to honestly care for his subordinates. He also has a habit of flipping people off in the manga.    \n\n __In the 2003 anime series:__  Greed is the second oldest of the Homunculi created by Dante. However, due to his avarice, Greed rebelled and was eventually captured and imprisoned in lab 5. He was imprisoned for 130 years until an explosion broke his seal. He then freed the caged chimera at Lab 5 in exchange for helping him get his revenge on the other homunculi and their master.    \n\n __In the manga and 2009 anime series:__  He is the third Homunculus created by Father. Greed apparently abandoned the other Homunculi over 100 years before the start of the series and claims to be around two centuries old. He first appears hiding in the Devil&#039;s Nest in Dublith, with his gang of chimeras all of whom he apparently rescued from military experimentation.      ~!After Greed is punished by Father, he later returns as Father removes his son&#039;s Philosopher&#039;s Stone core from his own body and inserts it directly into the body of Ling Yao to create a second Human-based Homunculus. This second Greed maintains all the same personality and powers as the first (his Ouroboros tattoo is even in the same spot), but appears to have none of his previous memories, not recognizing Envy, Gluttony, or the Elric Brothers. As such, he becomes a faithful servant of his Father, as the first Greed was presumed to have been initially, and refers to all actions prior to his rebirth as having been done by &quot;the other Greed&quot;.    After killing a past comrade and follower of his, memories from Greed&#039;s previous life returned, including his time in the Devil&#039;s Nest and the feelings he had for his followers. Remembering this, along with how Bradley killed most of his followers, leads Greed to betray Father once again. He also stops referring to his &quot;previous self&quot; as &quot;the other Greed&quot; upon regaining his memories.  !~ (Source: Wikia)",

Lust is also usually partnered with Gluttony to whom she appears to have a particular almost motherly closeness. Her Ouroboros mark is located on her collarbone, just above her breasts.     \n\n __In the 2003 anime series;__  She is largely the same as her manga counterpart, highly intelligent, manipulative, devoted to her own ideals, however she begins to crave becoming a human as the series progresses. Her main purpose amongst the Homunculi is gathering information and traveling abroad, manipulating alchemists into creating Philosopher&#039;s Stones. Gaining true humanity is the focal point of her ambition, arguably much more so than the rest of the Homunculi.     \n\n~!Lust was created by Scar&#039;s brother, when he attempted to use alchemy to bring his lover back from the dead. After he was cast out from Ishbalan society as a heretic, Envy visited the wretched creature and fed it red stones, giving her human shape, and her new name. She was not the first Homunculus to bear the name of Lust, and is the third youngest Homunculus.!~\n\n __In the manga and 2009 anime series;__  Lust is the only female Homunculus and the second to be created by Father. Due to her high intelligence and devotion to Father&#039;s plan, Lust appears to have a great deal of free reign and authority within the organization, seeming to have a position second only to Pride and on par with Wrath. Lust also has a great disdain for humans, thinking them frail, predictable and generally stupid. Moreover, she appears to take pleasure in using and throwing them away. Lust is the first to introduce the idea of Homunculi as superhuman, the next wave of evolution of humanity, and takes pride in her nature.    -Taken in part from Wikia.",

      "description": "__Occupation:__ Instigator for Father\n__Ability:__ Shapeshifting\n__Goal:__ Cause discord among humans\n\nEnvy is a homunculus who has the ability to shapeshift. They use this power to assume the form of any person and even copy their voice. They usually serve as a spy, but their abilities are also extremely useful for assassinations. Envy may not be as smart as some of the other homunculi, but they are by no means an idiot. In fact, they can be just as good a puppet master as Lust, but this is overshadowed by their cockiness and bad temper. This temper can easily be set off by insulting their large and delicate ego, causing them to make mistakes.  \n\n__In the 2003 anime series:__ As the oldest Homunculus, Envy claimed that they had forgotten what they originally looked like. Envy also greatly hates all humans and followed Dante mostly for the opportunity of killing as many people as they could. This is what drove Envy in all that they did and unlike other Homunculi, Envy does not care about the Philosopher's Stone, nor about becoming human. ~!Towards the very end of the series it is revealed that Envy was created four hundred years ago by Hohenheim in an attempt to resurrect the son he and Dante had, who later died from mercury poisoning when he was eighteen years old. Envy held a great hatred toward Hohenheim for never being acknowledged as his son and for abandoning them and Dante.!~  \n\n__In the manga and 2009 anime series:__ Envy was the fourth Homunculus created by Father. Though often referred to as a 'he' Envy is apparently genderless and can take almost any form it chooses. Referred to by Lust as the most cruel or sadistic of the Homunculi, Envy shows the most open disdain of humans and relishes in any opportunity to hurt, humiliate, or insult them. They are also quite vain and short tempered and dislikes anyone insulting their appearance. ~!Beneath this cruel exterior, however, Envy is secretly envious of humans' inner strength and the mutually beneficial friendships that they share, since most of the Homunculi show little real concern or emotional support for each other.!~  \n\n(Source: Fullmetal Alchemist Wikia)",
