Being a weak individual lacking an authoritative presence , he cannot help but let others push him around, a possible metaphoric stereotype on the very proper and manner conscious Japanese society. Recruited as the last member of BECK, he serves as the second guitarist and vocalist, and has a very beautiful voice that is mostly used for Beck&#039;s slower songs. He owns a Fender Telecaster.",
