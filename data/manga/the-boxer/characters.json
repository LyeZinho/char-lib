He becomes a professional boxer under the tutelage of the legendary [K](https://anilist.co/character/208937/K).\n\nYu has a very dark and melancholic appearance, with unstyled jet-black hair that drapes down loosely on his head, distinctively coal-black eyes with even darker pupils and a wholly disinterested facial expression painted on his face with an equally 'dead' look in his eyes. He has a very skinny body which belies his deceptively athletic abilities.\n\nYu has a startlingly emotionless and disinterested persona, taking little to no interest in anything other than his pet cat. He is shown to be alarmingly apathetic, simply taking hits because he couldn't be bothered to dodge them and giving zero response when threatened by an obviously vicious person.",
