He was a smart kid whose immigrant parents pushed him to extreme lengths to be a good student. His parents were so overbearing that he felt like he was driven to insanity. \n\nOlly became obsessed with Eli Jang after witnessing him destroy Backdoor. He did anything to get Eli's attention, stealing from minors and even robbing his own house. When Gun decided to destroy Hostel, Olly advocated for them and Gun decided to let them go, on the condition that Hostel becomes one of the four crews.\nHis reckless behavior and choices can be attributed to the fact that he cannot feel pain or emotions. This inability to feel anything also contributes to his obsession with Eli Jang because he believes that Eli is the only one who has made him feel anything previously, ~!but this is later revealed to be false, and his guilt over his involvement in Heather's death is really what caused the feelings!~",
