  "description": "Faced with imminent defeat and certain death, would you choose to run – or continue to fight for a doomed world? When mysterious towers appear across the world, summoning monsters that prey on mankind, this is the choice presented to the Tower Walkers – adventurers with special powers to fight the monsters. On the brink of death, they can choose to use a “regression stone” to return to the past for a second chance, though this decision places them in a separate timeline forever. Stubborn Tower Walker Jae-Hwan rejects this choice, choosing to fight for the original timeline, and learning shocking secrets about the Tower along the way.\n\n(Source: WEBTOON, edited)",
