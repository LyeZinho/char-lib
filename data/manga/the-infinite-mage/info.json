Despite the hardships of the peasant life, he learned how to read from a young age and became obsessed with books, especially ones on the history of magic. One day, he has an unlikely encounter with a mage and learns how to enter the \"spirit zone,\" the first step to learning how to use magic. Although they say only nobles can be mages, will Sirone be able to prove his infinite potential?\n\n(Source: Tapas)",
