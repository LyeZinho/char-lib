      "description": "Naho Takamiya is the main female protagonist in Orange. When she receives a mysterious letter from the future involving Kakeru Naruse, she and her friends try their hardest to fulfill the demands of the letter.\n\nNaho is a very loving and shy girl who tends to scream whenever she is nervous or embarrassed. She is shown to have a rather passive personality, as on multiple occasions throughout the series, Naho is unable to speak her own mind and tell people (especially Kakeru Naruse) how she feels, possibly out of fear of hurting or confusing them. Despite this, however, Naho's feelings for what she cares about are very strong and passionate, even if she doesn't show it. As she gets older, she opens up and is able to tell people her feelings straight, but still shares some of her shy and reserved traits from high school. She is also shown to be fairly oblivious to people's romantic interest towards her, as seen with Kakeru and Hiroto Suwa.",

He enjoys video games. Though he puts up a happy front around his friends and family, he hides his true feelings often and is incredibly depressed over his mother's death/suicide, in which he blames himself for it happening. As the story progresses, he finally lets some of his feelings loose to Hiroto Suwa and Naho Takamiya, though even after the incident, he seems to still believe his feelings are only a burden to others. He is also very hard on himself on a consistent basis. He claims to think about killing himself every day. He is also a skilled runner and is the fastest runner in his class.",
