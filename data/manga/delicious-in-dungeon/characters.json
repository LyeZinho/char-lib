When he appears again in the story, he appears more gaunt with sunken eyes and an unshaven face.\n\nOrdinarily, Shuro is a reserved man who doesn't often make demands of others. He has trouble expressing his true opinions to other people, instead relying on subtle social cues to imply what he feels. If the other party doesn't understand it, he tends to go along with what they say instead of push the issue. He seems to be impulsive under pressure, making snap decisions such as rescuing Falin by himself.\n\n~!His family is apparently of some noble lineage, as he has five retainers at his call. One of them, Maizuru, looked after him since he was a child. She noted that he was always reserved and never ate much, but ate plenty of whatever she made for him. Shuro arrived to The Island in order to train as a warrior. He was largely uninterested in monetary rewards or danger because of this.\n\nSometime after joining the Thorden siblings' party, Shuro fell in love with Falin when he woke one night and saw her enthralled instead of disgusted by a caterpillar on her finger, after which he proposed to her. She told him she needed time to think about it however, and unfortunately was eaten by the dragon before she could give an answer. Once they returned to the surface, Shuro left the party so he could rescue Falin with his retainers. He spent almost no time eating or resting during their descent through the dungeon.!~\n\n(Source: Dungeon Meshi Wiki)",

She is the second child of a noble family, the House of Vari, and was appointed by her parents to join the Canaries.\n\nShe appears to have a long-haired faerie as a familiar who acts primarily as a communicator between her and the other elves. She can transform her familiar into a magic staff to cast spells, including one that generates a physical barrier. While she seems to panic fairly easily, she seems to be the most proper of the team, stopping the other elves from laughing at Mithrun's mistake and reminding Sishys to keep her mind on the battle. She is also quite observant, noting Shuro and Namari's response when the chimerized Falin appears on the first floor.\n\n(Source: Delicious in Dungeon Wiki)",
