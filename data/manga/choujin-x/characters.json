Tokio is a second-year student at Tsuru High, and is a good friend of [Azuma Higashi](https://anilist.co/character/224490/Azuma-Higashi)'s. Following the events of the first chapter, Tokio became a Bestial Choujin.\n\nAs a small child, he and his classmates went on a field trip to a zoo, where they had to draw an animal that represented them. After Azuma got compared to a lion, Tokio's peers decided to mock him by comparing him to a vulture, an animal that has negative undertones associated with it. They continued to bully him until he broke down into tears before running away. Later, Azuma caught up to him and consoled him, pointing out a cool fact about vultures, which made Tokio see them in a more positive way. The event seemingly became a treasured memory for him, as his room can be seen decorated with a picture of a vulture.",
