Eren discovered this and helped her escape her captors. Later, Eren gave her his scarf, which she constantly wears and shares an emotional attachment to. She was adopted by the Yaeger family soon after. Because of these past events, Mikasa shares an unbreakable bond with Eren and lives to protect him, constantly worrying for Eren's well-being. After the Titans broke through Wall Maria and killed her and Eren's mother, she chose to follow Eren into the military to try and keep him safe from danger. \n\nEven as a child, Mikasa possessed impressive fighting skill and strength, and that skill was only honed further during her training.  Mikasa is considered a genius among all the army trainees and is incredibly skilled at combat and agility, to the point that she was known as the greatest soldier among the 104th Training Corps and graduated in first place. Though being among the best of the best, she remains humble and refrains from displaying arrogance. Ultimately, Mikasa's loyalty remains with Eren no matter the circumstance, with her only true desire being to live a peaceful life with him.",

As a child, he found and studied an illegal book about the outside world that was owned by his grandfather. He often shared the book and information contained in it with Eren Yeager, his best friend, and his dreams of seeing the world outside the walls. Armin was branded a heretic by other children for his unusual interest in the outside world and was thus frequently picked on. Too timid to defend himself, Armin would often rely on his friends Eren and Mikasa Ackerman to protect him from local bullies. This, coupled with his frail physique, was a deep shame for Armin, leading him to have poor self-esteem and to believe that he is a burden to others. Because of this, Armin has always been very eager to prove his worth, especially towards his close friends. \n\nArmin is known to be exceptionally loyal and selfless. He constantly worries for the safety of his friends, and he is always prepared to throw himself into dangerous situations to save them. Alongside his kindhearted nature and emotionally intelligence, Armin is a very analytical person. He likes to think deeply about situations and solve problems using his mind. These personality traits, in conjunction with his intelligence, good judgment, level headedness, ability to plan ahead, come up with creative ideas and to think outside the box, are what make him a great tactician. Although he may appear among the physically weakest of the 104th Training Corps, his incredible intelligence and strategic genius makes him an invaluable asset to any team.",

Though Oruo tries to come across as self-important, his cockiness is rarely taken seriously, and he is also shown to be somewhat clumsy, frequently biting his own tongue on accident while riding horses. Oruo also frequently attempts to imitate Levi, such as his rough speech and confident attitude, much to the frustration of one of his fellow teammates, [Petra Ral](https://anilist.co/character/62501).",

Ymir told Krista to leave him behind or her own life would be endangered; when Krista refused, Ymir used her Titan shifter powers to bring Dazz back to the camp safely.  In Ch. 12, when Dot Pixis announces the plan to reconquer Trost District, Dazz has a breakdown and starts screaming that he doesn't want to die. Though Marco Bott tries to quiet him, a commanding officer overhears and threatens to execute him. Dazz replies that execution would be better then being eaten by a Titan. However, Dot Pixis then announces that all deserters will be pardoned -- but have to live with the guilt that they abandoned their families to the Titans. Dazz is unable to leave his family to that fate, and returns to participate in the operation to plug the breach.   After the mission, he briefly appears in Chapter 21 standing next to Sasha Blouse when Irvin Smith gives a speech urging the 104th Training Squad members to join the Scouting Legion.

He compliments Mikasa for killing a Titan that was attacking a group of evacuating civilians.    ~!In Ch. 12, a plan is formed for Eren to use his Titan powers to seal the breach with a boulder. Ian is placed in charge of the elite squad assigned to protect Eren on his mission.   When Eren loses control of his Titan form in Ch. 13, Mitabi and Rico advise Ian to abort the mission and retreat. However, Ian orders his soldiers to continue to defend Eren down to the last man, as Eren is their only hope against the Titans.   In Ch. 14, Eren regains his senses due to Armin's intervention, and Ian orders his soldiers to protect him until he reaches the breach even at the cost of their own lives. Ian uses himself as bait to lure Titans away from Eren, sacrificing his life in order to ensure the success of the mission.!~ \n\n(Source: Shingeki no Kyojin Wikia)",

Decades prior, however, Kenny was known as an infamous serial killer that stalked victims in the capitol. \n\nDespite his dark field of work, Kenny appears to be rather jovial and takes pleasure in taunting his adversaries during battle. When fighting, he becomes animated and lively, often making a scene or otherwise throwing insults and witticisms. However, he also fought with control and was able to effortlessly sneak up on his targets when they least expected him. His preferred method of killing during his time as a serial killer was to slit the throats of his victims which earned him his infamous handle \"Kenny the Ripper\", and it was rumored that he murdered over 100 members of the Military Police Brigade. However, decades later his killings ceased and the terror that he once inspired dwindled into an Urban Legend. He eventually was found working under the Royal Government, the reasoning for his sudden shift in behavior being a mystery. Kenny is ultimately, despite his comical personality, very cold and calculated, sparing little emotional attachment or loyalty to anyone, with only a few exceptions.\n\n~!ㅤ\nHe notably shares the same bloodline as both [Levi](https://anilist.co/character/45627/Levi) and [Mikasa Ackerman](https://anilist.co/character/40881/Mikasa-Ackerman).!~",

When the 145th Fritz King built the walls and decided to move to the island Paradis, her branch of the Fritz family stayed behind due to disagreements with the King's choice. She joined the Eldia Restorationists on Marley, in order to revive the pride and power of Eldia. In this group, she also met Grisha Yeager, whom she eventually married. She gave birth to their son, Zeke Yeager. At the age of 7, there son reported his parents to the Marley government. As a result, all the Eldia Restorationists were sent to Utopia. Sergeant Major Gross injected Dina with the Titan serum and she was thrown off the Borderline wall to Utopia, as Grisha, in horror, watched his wife turn into a Titan.!~\n\n~!After the Colossus Titan breaches Shiganshina District in Wall Maria, many Titans proceed inside and among them is Dina. She embarks inside the town and is seen by Eren and Mikasa as they try to free Carla Yeager, who is trapped under the debris of their house. Though Hannes initially comes to their aid and decides to face Dina, he stands catatonic in fear of her frightening appearance. After he realizes that he is too afraid to face it, he opts to instead take Eren and Mikasa to safety, leaving Eren's mother behind. Afterwards, Eren witnesses Dina pull Carla out of the debris, as it proceeds to violently incapacitate her and devour her shortly thereafter.!~\n\n~!Five years later, after Eren had already joined the Survey Corps, Dina appears again before Eren and Mikasa outside the Titan Forest during the military's pursuit of the Armored Titan. After killing Hannes, who was protecting Eren and Mikasa before he was devoured, the Titan reaches out for Eren, who punches its hand. This activates powers Eren was previously unaware of, and seemingly gains control over the surrounding Titans. The ones that are under his control proceed to kill Dina by ripping her to shreds and devouring her, avenging the deaths of Carla and Hannes.!~",

She is a very tall woman with her blonde hair styled in a short bob with straight bangs. She has large dark eyes and somewhat androgynous features due to her build and style.\n\nYelena is a fervent follower of Zeke Yeager, holding great admiration and respect for him. She is usually calm and collected, her demeanour remaining unchanged even when Jean Kirstein yelled at her for failing to see her job through. Nonetheless, she is willing to take responsibility and apologizes should she fail in her task. Yelena appears to maintain a very relaxed demeanour while having dry, humorous undertones to much of her actions.\n\n~!It is later revealed that Yelena was born into an unassuming family in Marley, and eventually became disillusioned with her own country. After meeting Zeke Yeager, Yelena concocted a plan to solidify herself in history by helping Zeke save the world. As part of her narrative, Yelena created a false background for herself, claiming that her homeland was invaded and conquered by Marley. She was forcibly drafted as a soldier to fight in the Marleyan military, where she met similar-minded soldiers and organized them into the Anti-Marleyan Volunteers to fight against Marley.!~",

      "description": "Ymir Fritz was the progenitor of the Eldians. When she was a young girl, she awakened the power of the Titans and became the first Titan, the Founding Titan. After she died, her spirit was split into the Nine Titans. She is observed to be a quiet character that does not reveal her true intentions/motives.\n\n~!\nShe submitted to the Eldian king in life, building him his empire, brutally destroying his enemies, and bearing his children as he commanded. Ymir even went so far as to sacrifice her own life for his. Even in death, her soul remained blindly obedient to the Eldian royal family, creating Titans by hand for about 2,000 years in the unknown land surrounding the Coordinate. She has only shown signs of embracing her own free will after she encountered Eren Yeager. However, it is possible she always had some free will, as she had intentionally freed a group of pigs from their pen and let them run free as a slave.\n\nAccording to Eren, Ymir waited thousands of years for someone to come to her and free her from the love she felt for King Fritz. That person was Mikasa.\n!~\n\n(Source: Attack on Titan Wiki)",

Much of this mindset stems from her experiences during the Battle of Trost District, where she claims to have learned from watching Mikasa Ackerman fight in the face of adversity to achieve victory.
