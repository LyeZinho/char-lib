His name means, *just some guy*. He is the first to befriend [Shouko Komi](https://anilist.co/character/121956/Shouko-Komi).\n\nTadano is often described as an ordinary student with normal looks and average height and weight. His style of clothing is also considered to be relatively typical. His lone stand-out feature is the white cowlick in his black hair. When he was forced to cross-dress during the Cultural Festival, he was admired implicitly by the boys and Komi. His cross-dressing incorporates a short, red-haired girl's wig with pigtails.\n\nTadano suffered from chuunibyou in his second year of middle school. After confessing to a girl who immediately rejected him, he began to be self-conscious of his identity and drastically altered his style and outlook on life, making himself less noticeable to others. Almost everything about him - height, weight, appearance, academic achievements, athletic abilities, ice skating skills - is perfectly average. Despite his lack of talents, he's been shown to be good at observing and buying gifts for people.\n\nOn his first day of high school, he met Komi and was seated next to her. He later deduced that she had a communication disorder and became invested in helping her make 100 friends.\n\n~!Tadano can be clueless when it comes to romance, being unable to tell when someone else harbors romantic feelings for him, such as Komi and [Rumiko Manbagi](https://anilist.co/character/127449). He has a crush on the two, but is very unclear about it compared to the two.!~\n\n~!In chapter 301, it is revealed that Hitohito has a crush on Komi!~ ~!in chapter 302, Hitohito confesses to Komi.!~",

Though she's regarded as the *Madonna* of their school, she's incapable of socializing with others to such a level where it can be called a communication disorder.\n\nShouko is described by her admirers as a girl with glossy dark purple/black hair that flows to her lower back, a slender body, and an incredibly beautiful face. She is usually seen wearing her school uniform.\n\nShouko hardly talks with people. She is unable to utter a word nor sound in her daily life due to her crippling anxiety and fear of rejection by her peers. She often writes whenever she can on her notebook and to the blackboard in class to answer people. She dreams of overcoming her adversity and desires to build friendly relationships with others and make 100 friends.\n\nShouko's first friend was [Hitohito Tadano](https://anilist.co/character/78093/Hitohito-Tadano). He was the first to discover her bad communication. He helps her make friends and cares for her well-being.",

She becomes friends with Shouko Komi and Tadano Hitohito, her being the first Komi was able to befriend alone.\n\nManbagi is a manba-styled gyaru girl with tanned skin, bleached light hair, and a very girly fashion sense. She's introduced in ridiculous, heavy makeup, but once that's removed she is revealed to have a naturally beautiful face. She has shoulder-length, wavy blonde hair, a dark complexion, and a curvy figure. Manbagi had a short, black bob and fair skin when she was in middle school.\n\nManbagi is a cheerful, friendly girl who easily gets along with people once she becomes friends with them. In contrast to Komi, she's quite energetic and talkative. Though the two are more alike than it initially seems, both being sweet, lonely girls who desperately want friends. She seems somewhat naive and insecure, believing that her heavy makeup is what makes her pretty and thinking she doesn't compare to Komi.\n\nManbagi has a tsundere personality as she can be harsh to Tadano. That harshness has softened as she's become nicer, but can still be short-tempered when embarrassed.\n\n~!She develops a crush on Hitohito. Her tsundere personality comes from her shyness about the feelings she's developed for him after being called cute.\n\nIn chapter 264, she mumbles her love for Hitohito while falling asleep. Tadano overheard her, but she's unaware of this.!~",

She bears resemblance to her brother in terms of understanding people's minds. She is active, unlike her brother who is timid and more passive in doing things.\n\nHitomi is a short girl that shares the same big beady eyes as her older brother and make similar expressions. She wears her medium length hair in two short twin-tails.\n\nIn contrast to her older brother, who is usually seen as \"normal\", Hitomi is an energetic and eccentric girl. Unlike her more self-conscious brother, she's not as concerned with what others think, doing odd things such as introducing herself via rapping and not being embarrassed by it. Because of her cheery nature, she is well-liked among her peers.\n\nHitomi is rather blunt and forthright, openly claiming that she's not very good in either grades or sports during her class introduction. She does not seem to possess the same level of self-awareness as her older brother and tends to jump to conclusions.\n\nWhen [Shousuke Komi](https://anilist.co/character/130870/Shousuke-Komi) wasn't talking to her, Hitomi assumed he had a communication disorder when he was choosing to ignore her. Nonetheless, she does her best to \"help\" him communicate.",
