      "description": "A classmate of Kasuga who is portrayed as alone, isolated, and aloof. She has no friends. Nakamura witnesses Kasuga stealing Saeki's uniform and blackmails him to become her friend and form a contract. She displays hostile and rude behavior toward Kasuga, but can often be seen enjoying herself when with him. Though she maintains a usually sane and calm demeanor, Nakamura has occasionally had emotional outbursts when expressing herself to Kasuga. It is hinted that her desire to \"escape\" with Kasuga stems from a desire to no longer be alone. Nakamura earnestly believes that even if Kasuga chooses to stay or leave her, she will ultimately be isolated.",

      "description": "A middle school student who has a huge love for literature and a crush on Saeki. It is because of his infatuation of Saeki that he steals her gym uniform. Sawa Nakamura, an isolated loner in Kasuga's class witnesses him stealing the uniform. She then blackmails him into forming a contract, tying them together as \"friends.\"\n\n~! Initially against his contract with Nakamura, he cautiously followed her requests and disliked their meetings. However, over time he begins to see that Nakamura is actually lonely, and longs to escape from the people of the town, much like himself. Kasuga later develops strong feelings for Nakamura, promising to one day take her to the \"other side.\" !~\n\n~! Some time after the kerosene incident, he starts a new life, trying to keep his mind and heart calm. He states he doesn't have a death wish. Nonetheless, his feelings confuse him, and an old friend turns him to face his past. His hope now lies in friendship, with Tokiwa Aya-san. !~",
