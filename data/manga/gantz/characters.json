      "description": "~!He was a psychotic yet powerful teenager who participated in the game and won his freedom before the series's events. He desired to return to the game and used a SMG and a pistol to rampage through Shinjuku, killing Hiroto Sakurai, Kenzo Sakata, and Daizaemon Kaze, and either injuring or killing 387 bystanders in broad daylight. He thus not only brought Gantz new participants but also himself because he was killed by Kurono in a standoff. He is an incredible swordsman and was the first to use the Gantz Saber, a katana with a retractable blade that was hidden in one of the apartment's rooms. He can easily be seen as Kei Kurono's \"unfeeling\" and arrogant rival whose only ambition is to live his life striving to be the best Gantz fighter. He has proved willing to take innocent lives to make it happen (e.g. killing Tae Kojima in one of the missions.) When he earned 100 points for the second time, Izumi chose Option #2 - a strong weapon. Before he can use it, however, he is attacked by a legion of vampires in front of his apartment. After he killed all of them, the four vampire leaders attack him. Izumi managed to kill three of the leaders and was in combat with the blonde vampire before his girlfriend, Ryōko, tried to save him from the blonde vampire. Izumi protected her from the final blow by shielding her with his back. He then marveled at the scores of dead vampires he felled and states that he is definitely going to hell. As of the end of Phase I, Shion Izumi has not been revived.  (Source: Wikipedia)!~",

While running away from police officers after shoplifting, he fled onto an apartment building roof where he fell to his death.    Much like how Kurono started out, he is also selfish and has a Social Darwinist approach to life. Nishi is reluctant to reveal anything about the Gantz or himself, but he runs a web site where he posts information about it (carefully avoiding Gantz&#039;s rule about informing outsiders, which would in turn prove fatal). Gantz calls him &quot;Mr. Nishi,&quot; which is rather interesting given how informally or derisively he refers to most of the other participants.      ~!Nishi is killed at the beginning of the Tanaka/Suzuki Alien mission, but after six months of existing only inside Gantz&#039;s memory banks, he is revived by Kaze at Kurono&#039;s request following the end of the Oni mission. Ostensibly, Kurono hopes that Nishi will be able to provide information about Gantz to the game players.     After being ostracized and bullied by his classmates, which ended with them hurling him out of the classroom window, he has killed all of them (except one girl who had a crush on him and did not support the rest in wanting to chase him out of the school). After this, civil armed forces are sent to kill Nishi. Nishi manages to kill many of the men sent to kill him, but after an intense battle with the armed forces he is severely wounded and was only able to avoid death because Gantz called the Hunters for a new mission.!~",

He is then encouraged by Sakata to kill his bullies who sexually abused him with the use of his powers, which he does. However, he later regrets it, realizing how it feels to be a murderer. When he and Sakata witness Izumi's Shinjuku massacre, he insists in trying to stop Izumi and convinces Sakata to join him, arguing that it is a good opportunity to redeem themselves for the murders they committed themselves. While they do put up a good fight, Izumi still does manage to kill both, leading them to Gantz.  A phenomenal learner, he masters his abilities rather quickly. He dies in the fight against the Flame Oni, but is revived by Sakata. Gantz calls him \"Cherry\", taken from the Japanese Sakura and which is his online handle. He has a girlfriend named Tonkotsu who he first met after he murdered the people who abused him. With her, he is seen trying to catch murderers using his psychic powers, in order to further redeem himself. After the mission in Osaka, Gantz names him \"no longer a Cherry (Cherry is also the way Japanese address a virgin boy. No longer a Cherry in this term means that he is no longer a virgin)\".",

With &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, he leaves the others and tells her that he doesn&#039;t feel like eliminating them at that moment.    (Source: Wikipedia)",

His mother had been half-asleep and gave the hungry Takeshi permission to eat pudding from the refrigerator. When her boyfriend later comes home, he reacts violently and unintentionally kills Takeshi. Takeshi does not die instantly, and his mother and her boyfriend leave him, believing him to be alive. Before his death, draws a fictional hero called \"Muscle Rider\", and when he awakes inside Gantz's room as a participant in the game he believes that Kaze is \"Muscle Rider\". Kaze watches over Takeshi during his first mission, and Kaze later decides to let him stay with him after learning of Takeshi's cause of death. Takeshi continues to believe that Kaze is Muscle Rider. By chapter 240, he discovers and uses the abilities of the suit, including the utilization of the \"back attack\", Kaze's signature move. Despite Takeshi's small size, he is capable of defending himself against average opponents. Having imitated Kaze's fighting style, Takeshi manages to dispel a group of monsters that surround him, as well as injure a rather large creature that comes from the river, earning himself 26 points at the end of the mission. He later even lands a surprise attack on the Gantz veteran, Nishi.",

Eventually, he realizes his only chance of survival is under Kurono&#039;s guidance. And at the end of the Oni mission, he gives Kurono his support. He is quite the coward when it comes to fighting, and tries to feign a cool head in these situations. It is hinted at numerous occasions that he is attracted to Reika, and he has admitted the fact to an Oni Alien he thought was Reika, subsequently having sex with the alien. After the Oni mission, he gains respect for Kurono and believes that Kurono could actually become the group leader. Despite the fact that Kurono dies, he still participates with the other Gantz team members in fighting the aliens.    (Wikipedia)",

Kurono thought that Inamori had a girly face.   ~!During the mission Inamori was careless with the weapons. When he first picked up an X-Gun he pulled a single trigger while pointing it at Masashi, avoiding killing him only by chance. He also pointed the rifle at Hatanaka Hiroshi, making him angry, and demolished a wall when he missed shooting the Onion Alien. He later killed Hatanaka by accidentally shooting him when the big onion alien used his body as a shield to block the X-rifle.  Inamori was killed by the big onion alien during the first mission. !~",

He did not put on a suit before they were all transferred to the temple, nor did he bring one along just in case.   He goes along with the others, running with them when the two large statues at the front of the temple come to life and chase them. When all the human size aliens start to appear he starts to fight them using martial arts. He takes a few down on his own. When Kato makes 2 groups he goes with Hojo's group. When most of the group runs inside at the end, to the final building with aliens in it, he goes along with them.    ~!He fights one of the spawns and wins for the most part. JJ gets his hand trapped by the spawn and snaps his bone. JJ head buts him and then another one of the spawn breaks his neck before he has time to recover. !~",

He never gets any points because of \"too much tongue/tail wagging\". He is present in every mission until he is replaced by the panda.  Rice was abandoned on a walk by its owner, who ran away from him. When trying to chase its owner it was hit by a dump truck, killing it and sending it to the Tokyo room for the first time, surprising its only veteran hunter Joichiro Nishi who expected it to die just like all others, but being surprised the first four times the dog survives just like him. Nishi then ignores the dog for their following missions until finally three others survive who inquire about him, with Nishi flatly stating he always survives, ~!which held true until after Nishi's own death.!~ \n\nRice is an enthusiastic, friendly dog. Whom is pretty aware of the things that happen around him. When Gantz starts scoring people he eagerly waits for his own only to be berated by him for not doing anything while showing him his score of zero points which upsets Rice. Rice's most characteristic trait is that he appears to be a butter dog, trying on more then one occasion to lick Kei Kishimoto's vagina. Making Kurono wonder if he used to belong to some lonely housewife who trained him to do so.\n\nIn the anime, Rice was also able to warn the other players that there were more enemies to fight, such as when he started barking at the smaller statues during the Buddhist Temple mission. All in all out of all the humans he interacts with he seems the most fond of Kishimoto. The anime shows her putting his Gants suit on him and hugs him when she learns he survived and in the manga they even appear on a number of chapter covers together.",

Thus, at the end of the mission he swears, he will revive Anzu for Kato.!~\nHis name is not given, probably for the reason, that he represents the average manga reader/otaku, who dreams about becoming a hero, doing some respectful deeds if he gets the power to.\n\nDespite being a much more valuable rookie than any of his idols ever were, and in fact the fastest-to-clear and top-scoring average points per game player known, he continues his inferiority complex and hero worship of veteran Gantz sempais. He wonders if he could ever reach Katou, although his own shy and self-deprecating actions are consistently as brave or braver and far more selfless than Katou's (also fights Nuri 1on1, successfully saves little girl from the hell of Italy despite his terror and losing limbs protecting her, scores over 100 points in just 2 rounds to resurrect near-stranger Yamazaki for Katou's sake, loses a foot protecting Yamazaki in alien colony, attacks alien Hero in mothership while Katou stands frozen with fear and doubt, etc.).",
