      "description": "__Height:__ 175 cm (5'9\")\n\nSaitama is the main protagonist of One Punch Man, and the most powerful hero alive. Having apparently trained himself to superhuman condition, Saitama faces an existential crisis as he is now too powerful to gain any thrill from his heroic deeds.  He is registered with the Heroes Association as a B-Class Superhero and is tasked to defend Z-City against Mysterious Beings. \n\nFor a superhero, Saitama is rather laid-back. Because even the mightiest foes pose no challenge to him, he doesn't take his hero work very seriously. In spite of this, he is constantly searching for an opponent that can challenge him, since his superhero work is beginning to bore him because it's too easy. The combination of his attitude, unstoppable strength, and distinctively simple and 'unimpressive' appearance often cause his battles to become anticlimactic. Saitama will usually allow his opponents to rant about their motives and power up into their strongest forms before suddenly and nonchalantly obliterating them with one punch.",

He wears a turtleneck sweater, has sunken cheeks, a defined jawline and a squarish chin. Notably, a loud drumming sound may be heard in his proximity. The King Engine is a rumbling sound that others claim occurs when King readies for battle or when he is generally serious having an intimidating effect on his opponents. ~! In actuality, it is simply the sound of King's heartbeat which, when he is frightened, is so loud that it can be heard outside his body, but because of King's intimidating reputation people mistake it for bloodlust. King is able to appear to remain calm in threatening situations as well as put out an extremely threatening aura. Despite the intimidating personality King projects, he is actually a coward and an otaku. He has been shown to get very excited about buying a dating game. Saitama saved his life many times, but always end up getting all the credits that was supposed to be for the latter. With this misunderstanding, he came to be known as \"the strongest man on earth\".

He does not consider other human villains to be allies, wiping out a large group of them along with the heroes present. He will also attack low ranked hero and hero staff members if he encounters them. A large aspect of his personality seems to be some sort of disdain for his former master, Bang, enough to avoid using the Water Stream Rock Smashing Fist he was taught unless seriously cornered.\n\nHe has no remorse even for people who aid him, as he smashed Licenseless Rider's face soon after the latter defended him.\n\nAlthough Garou is an evil character, he possesses some kind of morality: he lets heroes live so that they can grow stronger and fight him again.\n\nIn some ways, Garou can be considered the opposite to Saitama.

He is considered to be very handsome by the public. Aside from being a hero he is also a famous model, actor and singer, being the most popular one in the world. Sweet Mask has stated that he believes that heroes are to protect the citizens, and if they can't do that, they must become strong enough to be able to do so. He also genuinely cares for the well-being of the citizens around him and actually wishes happiness upon every living thing in the universe. However, befitting the darker side of Sweet Mask's name is his hidden merciless nature. He is shown to have a burning hatred for anything that he sees as evil. Anything that he declares as evil must be swiftly and thoroughly exterminated. \n\nSweet Mask is shown to adhere to any method that makes heroes popular. He notes that only promotions to S-Class or A-Class are fit for his attention, as they are the heroes who draw the most attention from the public, and hence, any heroes in those ranks who earn themselves negative reputations would drag his reputation down as well. Because of this, Sweet Mask stays in the A-Class Rank 1 position to prevent unworthy heroes from promoting to S-Class. \n\nSweet Mask is very narcissistic about \"beauty overwhelming the power\", as he said about his philosophy that \"heroes have to be beautiful as well\". This became obvious when he showed interest in a worthy S-Class Hero like Genos, who has both a beautiful appeal and having done more heroic deeds as the main priority, fitting Sweet Mask's philosophy. \n\n~! However, after witnessing the defeat of Garou by Saitama, his viewpoint changes and becomes more focused on the overwhelming power of the individual than beauty alone. !~",

He needs only a few minutes to recover from an extremely mutilated state and regrow his left arm, however this regeneration does not give Zombieman full immortality, as he will die if he is reduced to mincemeat.

      "description": "**Race**: Human\n**Occupation**: Hero\n**Affiliation**: Hero Association\n**Rank**: S Rank 1\n\nBlast is the S-Class Rank 1 professional hero of the Hero Association. Without the knowledge of [Saitama](https://anilist.co/character/73935/Saitama)'s strength, he is largely suggested to be the Hero Association's most powerful hero. He currently appears to be going to various places to collect God's cubes, which is a hobby of his. Only a few select Hero Association staff members have the means to communicate with him.\n\nBlast is a tall man of muscular build, with spiky, graying hair and a slight beard. He wears bulky armor with large shoulder pads, a large cape worn out at the bottom, and emblems of his name on his chest and the backs of his shoes. His gloves have circles on the back of his fists, which form an infinity symbol when he presses them together to teleport. His suit has mild damage, presumably sustained from his many battles. He also wears shades and has a scar running across his face between his eyes. The outline of his iris is a wavy black pattern, as opposed to just a consistent outline seen in other characters. In the past, Blast's appearance was largely similar to today, but he looked younger, with darker hair and no beard. Additionally, neither his armor nor himself had sustained damage or injuries, and he did not wear shades.\n\nBlast does not disclose his personal information in the Hero Association Catalog. However; akin to Saitama, he considers his hero work as just a hobby. He also seems to have independent tendencies, keeping his location and status unknown. He seems to not be completely out of touch with other heroes, as he recognized [Flashy Flash](https://anilist.co/character/138981/Flashy-Flash) and knew his exact ranking.\n\n(Source: One-Punch Man Wiki, edited)",

Homeless Emperor was once a raw recruit at a company, but he ended up getting fired after a new employee welcoming party due to being accused of sexual harassment. He lost his home and became homeless, and almost committed suicide because of how he viewed humans. He believed that humans were a disease on Earth, trampling the planet and running it over with man-made devices. He felt the only way to escape this world and return to nature, was to die. However just as he prepared to die, a mysterious being known as \"God\" approached him. The being told him that he shares Homeless Emperor's sentiments about the nature of humans, convincing him that he doesn't need to die and then granted him powers. Homeless Emperor then resolved to exterminate humanity using his newfound powers, and soon joined the MA to gain assistance in his efforts.",
