Isagi grew up watching soccer and aspiring to be like Noel Noa, a forward for France's National Team.  Due to this, he dreams of becoming the best striker in the world. In turn, Isagi played striker for his school soccer team, who was defeated in the Prefectural Finals by Matsukaze Kokou High. After this loss, Isagi is invited to participate in the Blue Lock Project, ranked 299th of 300 strikers, and is assigned to Team Z.\n\nIsagi is easygoing and has a generally friendly, cheery personality, but his simple and innocent habits often get on the nerves of the people around him. As time goes on, Isagi develops a more assertive presence on and off the field, becoming the foundation for Team Z and garnering the respect of some of the best players in Blue Lock.",
