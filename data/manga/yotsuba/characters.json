      "description": "__Height__: 107 cm\n\nShe has a carefree and energetic personality, taking delight in simple matters even as she learns about all manner of things in her daily life. In Japanese, Yotsuba's dialogue is written without kanji, making it seem simpler and more child-like, and in a typeface that gives the impression of speaking with high intensity. Her energy is noted by other characters, especially members of the neighboring Ayase family. Her father says of her carefree nature, \"She can find happiness in anything. Nothing in this world can get her down.\" However, when deeply frightened or upset, she does cry, and she has an unexplained fear of anything resembling a bullseye.\n\nAt the start of the series, Yotsuba is shown as having very little knowledge of the world around her, even for a young child. Things such as swings, doorbells, cicadas, and air conditioners all fascinate and confuse her, although she is not perturbed by her ignorance. She occasionally mispronounces new words and creates neologisms, such as \"Yotsubox\" as a portmanteau of \"Yotsuba's Box\", and often repeats, in incongruous ways, phrases spoken by adult characters around her.\nYotsuba is frequently shown drawing, though she is not as good an artist as she thinks she is, and she is an excellent swimmer.\n\nThe series provides few details about her life before its start. She is an adopted child, with her birthplace unknown to the reader, although she claims she's from an island \"to the left.\" Koiwai, Yotsuba's adopted father, says he met her as an orphan in a foreign country and before he knew it he was raising her as his own; she is sometimes taken for a foreigner by strangers. When asked about her mother, she doesn't understand the question, and she gets confused by the concept of having two sets of grandparents. Before moving to her current home, Yotsuba lived in the country with Koiwai and his mother. She initially claims to Fuka Ayase she is six years old, but her father later corrects this, saying she is in fact five years old. Yotsuba has never attended school, and as of the first chapter does not know what a grade is. In chapter 35, she fails to understand repeated explanations of homework.",

The circumstances of her adoption are obscure; he tells Fuuka that without intending to, he found himself taking care of her while somewhere overseas, but gives no other details. Though he acknowledges Yotsuba is a bit odd, he can be offbeat himself. He is depicted as something of a slacker; he habitually wears an undershirt and boxer shorts when working at home during the summer, and apologizes more than once for being irresponsible. He works from home as a translator, though what languages and materials he translates is unknown. Regardless of his skills as a parent, Koiwai tries to be a good father to Yotsuba.",

He helps the Koiwais move in and frequently visits their house, where he is more or less treated as a member of the family by Yotsuba.\n\n__Personality__: Jumbo has a dry sense of humor and is prone to deadpan quips, which sometimes confuse members of the Ayase family. At the same time, he is impulsive, and sometimes spontaneously organizes activities for the younger children, such as fishing and star-gazing.\nAs he does this, he enters a bizarre one-sided rivalry with Miura, including spending a single day in Hawai&#039;i after he learns that she will be going abroad. He develops a deep infatuation with Asagi when he first meets her, but is too nervous around women to directly act on it. Instead, he tries to use Yotsuba&#039;s friendship with Asagi as a way of getting close to her, though his plans usually backfire.",

Her attempts to spare Yotsuba&#039;s feelings sometimes lead her to make little white lies, such as praising Yotsuba&#039;s childish sketches or letting her believe that Miura&#039;s cardboard costume is a real robot named Cardbo (in ADV&#039;s translation) or Danbo (in Yen&#039;s translation) (ダンボー, Danbō), with consequences that rebound on herself and Miura. Ena likes drawing, something at which she is quite skilled, and playing with her teddy bears, either by herself or with Yotsuba. Ena is unsqueamish and even enthusiastic about such things as handling large frogs and gutting live fish.",

For example, she immediately notices Jumbo&#039;s infatuation with Asagi and uses it to her advantage. She is also extremely squeamish: when Jumbo takes the younger children fishing, Miura refuses to handle live bait, using salmon roe instead, and hides while Jumbo and Ena clean their catches; she is also terrified by a large frog Yotsuba catches. Miura often wears sports-related clothing (such as jerseys of the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Dodgers) and rides a unicycle. Jumbo once teases her by calling her Lamborghini Miura.",
