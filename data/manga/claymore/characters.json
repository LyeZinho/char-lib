She also holds the distinction of becoming the first individual to willingly become a claymore.  Her goal is revenge against the awakened being Priscilla.  She saves Raki from a youma and takes him under her care because he reminds her of herself when she was younger.

When the \"Claymore\" Clare arrives in Raki's town to kill the Yoma, it turns out the Yoma camouflaged itself as Raki's older brother after killing the other family members. After killing the Yoma and saving Raki, Clare leaves the town. However, the superstitious villagers throws Raki out, fearing that he might turn into a Yoma himself after being so close to one. Raki follows Clare, and is eventually allowed to accompany her as her cook.  But the true hardships has not yet begun for Clare and Raki...   ~!He begins learning swordsman ship under Isley of the north to become strong enough to help Clare, and is shown travelling with a regressed, child-like Priscilla. Raki is shown wearing Claymore-like Armour and wielding a massive broadsword. He easily defeats a Yoma pointed out to him by Priscilla and displays remarkable reflexes and speed. It is unknown how powerful he is in relation to Claymores or Awakened Beings, though he is shown wielding a sword somewhat larger than the ones wielded by the Claymores one handed and easily deflected the youma's attack using his forearm armor.  Raki's dialogue reveals that he now knows Priscilla's true nature. Raki also mentions that Priscilla's small frame is probably due to the fact that she has not eaten any human flesh for a few years, although she is probably \"at her limit\". He says that, should she submit to her hunger, he will attempt to stop her but acknowledges that he will probably fail and be eaten.  Later on he is impaled through the shoulder by an iron rod contaminated with tissue from an awakened being. Though he is the only survivor out of the entire village where it occurred, an infection has started to spread through his body, threatening to change him into a yoma. From sheer willpower, he manages to keep a slight grip on his humanity and keep the infection from spreading.The Claymore organization later takes him back to their headquarters to analyze what is happening to him.!~",

Despite facing an awakened former number one, Rosemary, she has never used more than ten percent of her full power, which is only enough to change her eye color. Before becoming a Claymore, she was referred to as a &quot;problem child&quot; by her handlers during her training. Teresa initially does her job without caring about who she is helping, and she takes pleasure in scaring humans. She eventually meets Clare, who decides to start following Teresa after being abandoned by her village. Teresa is initially irritated, but soon grows fond of her. \n\n~!After leaving Clare in a village in an attempt to give her a normal life, bandits raid the village. Teresa kills all of them, which causes her to be hunted by the Organization for breaking the rule of never killing humans. She doesn&#039;t kill any of the Claymores after her because of her time with Clare, but she is slain by Priscilla off guard when Priscilla begs to be slain before awakening. Clare takes her severed head and convinces a member of the Organization to use it in place of a Yoma to turn her into a Claymore.!~  (Source: Wikipedia)",

She was the number one in the first generation of female Claymores and the youngest ever to awaken. She presents herself as cheerful and polite, though she will instantly discard anyone who gets in the way of her goals. She lives with her lover, Dauf, and she constantly attempts to force strong Claymores to awaken, often through torture, in order to increase her companions. She later focuses her interest on matching Isley and Priscilla&#039;s power in order to stop them from advancing into her territory, and she finds the merged form of Rafaela and Luciela. She wishes to awaken the new being, and captures Ren&eacute;e for that reason.    Riful&#039;s awakened form retains a feminine humanoid form, but one composed of fleshy strips. Her lower body is an immense mass of such strips, which are incredibly resilient and capable of lashing out at high speeds to ensnare or impale her opponents. Her enemies often attempt to attack the humanoid portion, though it simply splits into the strips when attacked.     ~!After Rafaela/Luciela&#039;s Awakening and the chaos that ensued, Riful was attacked by the Abyssal Feeders and Alicia, and was rendered too weak to use her Awakened Form and left with one human leg remaining (forcing her to use some of her &quot;tentacles&quot; to help her stay upright). She burst into tears at the thought of dying like this and begged Dauf not to help her in fear of him dying. Before Alicia could kill her, Beth&#039;s Awakening and fight against Priscilla caused Alicia to abandon Riful and assist her sister, although she was killed in the process. This doesn&#039;t last for long, as Priscilla finds her Yoki and presumable kills Dauf and her. It turns out Duaf lived but deliberately according to Priscilla let himself be infected with the Destroyers Projectiles. After a surprise attack on Priscilla where he pounds her into the ground Duaf throws the top half of Riful&#039;s body on the ground. Deneve and Helen presume its a human woman&#039;s corpse which shows she has died as she emits no yoki and doesn&#039;t move.!~",
