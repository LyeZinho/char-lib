      "description": "Endo Kenji grew up in late-1960s/early-1970s Japan, at a time when American phenomena, notably the space race and the era of Woodstock, were resounding around the world.  An avid reader of manga who often saw apocalyptic scenarios playing out, he always responded with the cry of \"I would fight\".  During this time, he and his friends made up a scenario for world conquest in order to play heroes.  Flash forward to 1997, when Kenji has taken charge of his family liquor shop, and turned it into a convenience store.  He is now raising the daughter of his sister, Kiriko (who disappeared immediately after leaving her daughter to Kenji), and living a fairly ordinary life.  However, after events from the prophecy he made up earlier begin to come true, he learns of an evil organization, led by a masked man called \"Friend\", which is using his plans to conquer the world.  As the organization's hold on the government strengthens, he becomes a wanted man and lives on the streets, continuing to (covertly) oppose Friend on the streets, partially through terrorism and partially through a protest song he wrote (named \"Bob Lennon\"), until  ~!he apparently dies trying to stop an exploding giant robot, just after seeing Friend's unmasked face.!~   ~!He survives however, although we do not know of any of his actions prior to meeting Damian Yoshida, gutarist of the Thriller band the Eroim Esseims, in 2014 at a crossroads and subsequently teaching him how to play \"Bob Lennon\".  It appears that he may have been suffering from amnesia at this time, as he identified himself as the devil (in a reference to the real life Blues  legend of Robert Johnson, said to have influenced rock 'n' roll.)  He then continued to wander Japan until the third year of Friend era (era in which Friend was declared president of the world), when a sudden surge of memory causes him to recall his identity.  While heading to Tokyo, he meets up with old friend Konichi, now a radio DJ, who, oblivious to Kenji's true identity, records his song  (a version of \"Bob Lennon\" with modified lyrics) and subsequently broadcasts it on radio.  As Kenji makes his way past border guards now under Friend's control, using charisma and song, he gains more and more of a following.  Once he reaches Tokyo, he confronts Friend and watches him and another old friend, Sada Kiyoshi, die together in an explosion.  Finally, he reunites with his old friends and niece, and there the story ends. !~",

His goal appeared to be to encourage her to fulfill her dream of studying microbiology and use her expertise to create the deadly virus. When Kiriko realized that Fukubei was creating a cult around himself, she gave the police everything she knew about him and left her child, Kanna with Kenji and their mother. Unfortunately, the detective she gave it to was Yama and he had already defected to friend at the time, so her evidence was destroyed. Kiriko then went to see Yamane and convinced him about Fukubei's true intentions. Upon realizing how deadly the new virus that Yamane made was, she decided to spend all her time and effort making a vaccine.  Kiriko feels extremely guilty over her involvement in the creation of the virus, as such she has spend most of her time trying to out-maneuver Friend and create a vaccine that would be distributed to everyone. As a last gamble in Friend year 3, Kiriko exposes herself to the next generation of the virus to test out her own vaccine. Fortunately the vaccine works and Kiriko survives.!~\n\n~!In 21st Century Boys, Kiriko seems to be working in some African country as a volunteer doctor.
