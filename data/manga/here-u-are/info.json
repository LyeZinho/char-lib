  "description": "They say opposites attract, and that couldn’t be more true for Yu Yang and Li Huan. Yu Yang is chatty and outgoing, while Li Huan speaks in monosyllables and walks around with a perpetual scowl on his face. Although they get off to a rocky start, Yu Yang eventually learns that beneath Li Huan’s reserved exterior lies a soft heart. Over time, the two slowly begin falling for each other… but will their budding romance be strong enough to withstand all the obstacles thrown their way?\n\n(Source: WEBTOON, edited) \n\nNote: Includes 20 extra chapters.",
