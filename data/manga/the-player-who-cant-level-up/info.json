  "description": "When Kim Kigyu received his invitation to become a player (a unique-ability player, at that), he thought his struggles were over. But no matter how hard he tries, he just can’t seem to get past level 1! After five years of working as a guide on the lower floors of the tower, he’s finally discovered his ability to link with “Egos” and raise his stats. As his new skills unlock adventures in unexplored gates, Kigyu gets his chance to defy expectations and show the world that rank isn’t everything.\n\n(Source: Tapas)",
