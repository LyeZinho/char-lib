Spending each afternoon in the girls bathroom masturbating, he loves being able to picture doing perverted things with females who wouldn't normally look at him twice. With much to learn about life, Kakeru finds that friendship and romance are much more important than painting the inside of a toilet stall.    Kurosawa spends time at the school library everyday, reading. He reads many books. He is also camera-shy and does not socialize with others, preferring to be a loner.",
