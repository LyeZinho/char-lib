Even though she is an Ajin, she chose to live between humans in secret and doesn't seem to be consumed completely by resentment towards humans despite her background. She seems to be quite intelligent and understanding, both towards Tosaki and when interrogating Nagai Kei's younger sister, Eriko. However, despite her initial stoic appearance, she can get embarrassed easily (for example when she said too much to Eriko and when Tosaki commented on her casual clothes).\n~!Due to her past trauma caused by both of her parents and love life, she became very depressed and suicidal, often cutting herself and eventually ends up attempting suicide.!~",

He is also a bit clumsy compared with other characters and often doesn't know what's going on. As seen in the recent chapters, he is not good with coming up with plans and prefers to improvise instead. This results in him relying on Kei a lot with strategic plans, much to Kei's annoyance. \n\nit is revealed that Kō had first died when changing a light bulb. He stacked a bunch of magazines on top of each other, and tripped. After that, he was left paralyzed on the floor for days, but no one came. He then most likely died of dehydration. It is also pointed out that Kō had abusive, or at least neglective, parents.",

It isn't above him to resort to violence through either his own force or those beneath him to get something done.
