Following a rejection from his friend on the day of his junior high graduation, he goes to a matchmaking shrine and prays to the shrine's god, wishing for a happy high school life by getting a girlfriend. In response, the Love God appears before Rentarou, telling him that he will meet his \"soulmate\" in high school, and that they will fall in love at first sight. He then reveals that Rentarou has 100 of such soulmates, and that should he ever meets one, he must make them his girlfriend and make them happy, or else they will die.",
