The very magic that inspired her was simple magic made by Qifrey's watcher that caused glowstone path to light up.",

      "description": "Qifrey is a witch and Coco's teacher. He runs an atelier and currently has four disciples.\n\nHe is a caring teacher who patiently teaches his students magic. This is especially true for Coco, who has no special abilities as a witch at first but he continues to encourage her until she can draw magic skillfully. He is protective of all his disciples, as seen from how he protects them from being taken by Esheath from the Magic Security Council. However, Qifrey is overly obsessed with his goal to locate the Brimmed Hats, with his gentle attitude oftentimes replaced by a buried hatred he has always hidden. It appears he had a personal agenda against the Brimmed Hats, as well.\n\n~!The reason Qifrey has a grudge towards the Brimmed Hats is that they are responsible for taking away his memories and right eye as a child. He was later locked in a coffin, buried under a tree, and left there to die as it slowly filled with water. Thankfully, people from the Magic Security Council and Sage Beldarut found him and rescued him from his miserable condition, which later on he would become the pupil of Sage Beldarut. Qifrey also went to the Tower of Books in order to find an answer on how to solve the problem of his missing memories and right eye, but for that, he must use forbidden magic, and as such his issue remains unsolved.!~",
