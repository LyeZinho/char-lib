He comes across as fairly timid and insecure, but often has spurs of confidence. He suffers from delusions and is very anxious, especially when in the dark. Despite Japan's strict laws on firearms, he owns a shotgun to which he has a license. This makes him a very desirable person to hang around with following the outbreak, but Hideo is very serious when it comes to the law and won't allow anyone else to even touch his gun.",

As first, she mistakes him for someone contemplating suicide and comforts him, after which the two become close friends.\n\nShe has a boyfriend who she simply acknowledges as Shinji, though she hasn't seen him since the outbreak.\n\n~!Later, she is infected by a zombie baby but still retains most of her personality. However, at times she starts to see the world as some sort of child-like vision, viewing people as off-putting stuffed animals. After being infected, her strength increases substantially.!~\n\n~!During their refuge at the Outlet Mall, Hiromi is shot in the head by a nail gun. Afterwards, Oda is able to use her knowledge as a nurse to remove the nail and Hiromi surprisingly makes a complete recovery, from both being shot and her infection. She loses all the superficial symptoms of her infection, such as protruding black veins and bloodshot eyes, but retains much of her superhuman strength.!~",

Many people on the internet have gone on to form a quasi-religious cult around Kurusu, proclaiming him as their prophetic leader in the new age that will emerge from the disaster; however, he doesn't seem to care about this at all and is only interested in killing.\n\nLater on, \"Kurusu\" is a term used to refer to the Japanese people who manage to fight off the infection.\n\n~!After a fight between him, the Naked Emperor and Takashi, they are all assimilated into a single entity that can switch appearances according to whichever personality is in control. When the female supply squad member in Tokyo is also assimilated, the Naked Emperor shows her Kurusu's true form, visible only when his personality is \"asleep\": an old, frail man that couldn't move nor talk since childhood, and only stayed in bed.!~",
