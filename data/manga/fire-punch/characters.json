      "description": "Agni is the titular protagonist of Fire Punch. He is a large, muscular young man with black hair and his entire body is on fire except for his mouth and the left side of his face. Agni possesses the blessing of Regeneration. His regeneration is extremely powerful, as he is able to regrow lost limbs instantly and even regenerate from being beheaded.\n\nOn his way home one day, he sees a plane flying towards the village. Investigating, he sees a large group of men rounding up the older members of the village at gunpoint. He intervenes, telling the men to leave the elders alone. Agni is approached by a man who introduces himself as [Doma](https://anilist.co/character/120595/Doma), stating they are searching for Blessed Ones to bring with them to the city of Behemdolg. Upon hearing one of the soldiers report that the village houses were filled with human meat and the villagers were in fact cannibals, Doma orders the soldiers to return to the plane before setting the village ablaze with his Fire Blessing. Agni is left burning, as his Blessing prevents him from dying, surrounded by charred corpses and burning buildings. Longing to die as he thinks of his family, a heavily burned [Luna](https://anilist.co/character/238189/Luna) shuffles towards him. Just before her body is reduced to ash, she utters a single word: “Live”. \n\n~!After countless millennia, Agni and [Judah](https://anilist.co/character/147002/Judah) reunite in space and fall asleep together. It is implied they die together, thus the entire human race has been wiped out.!~",

Togata ended up accompanying [Agni](https://anilist.co/character/120594/Agni) on his journey and even helping him out at times.\n\nTogata often comes off as an unempathetic, but high-energy person, not caring for the feelings and wellbeing of others. Togata tends to find awe in some of the harsher aspects of life. \n\n~!Togata is a trans man. However, due to his ability to regenerate from any wound in nearly an instant, he found himself unable to undergo a sex change. \n\nDespite his cruel traits, he has allowed himself to be more vulnerable around people, notably Agni, who he pities greatly. In a moment of vulnerability after having been outed, Togata reveals to Agni his debilitating dysphoria and disconnect with his own self due to being alive for over 300 years. His hyperactive persona is a façade, and his \"true\" self is self loathing, pessimistic, and hates to be pitied on.!~\n\n~!In an effort to stop Agni from committing suicide, Togata sacrifices himself.!~",
