  "description": "The air of celebration surrounding fifteen-year-old Oz Vessalius&rsquo;s coming-of-age ceremony quickly turns to horror when he is condemned for a sin about which he knows nothing. He is thrown into an eternal, inescapable prison known as the Abyss from which there is no escape. There, he meets a young girl named Alice, who is not what she seems. Now that the relentless cogs of fate have begun to turn, do they lead only to crushing despair for Oz, or is there some shred of hope for him to grasp on to?\n\n(Source: Yen Press)\n\nNote: Includes two extra chapters and the pilot one-shot.",
