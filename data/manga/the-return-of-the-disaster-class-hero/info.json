  "description": "Humans call them “calamities”—the unknown, destructive creatures that suddenly appeared on earth. To challenge these calamities, the zodiac gods awakened 12 humans known as saints. But there was one more that awoke—unchosen but the greatest hero of all: Geon Lee. His allies betrayed him and left him for dead, but now, 20 years later, he’s more powerful than ever and ready to teach his fellow “saints” a lesson they’ll never forget. \n\n(Source: Tapas)",
