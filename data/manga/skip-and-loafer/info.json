  "description": "Excellent student Iwakura Mitsumi has always dreamt about leaving her small town, going to a prestigious university, and making positive change in the world. But she’s so focused on reaching her goals that she’s not prepared for the very different (and overwhelming) city life that awaits her in a Tokyo high school. Luckily, she makes fast friends with Shima Sousuke, a handsome classmate who’s as laid-back as she is over-prepared. Can this naive country girl make it big in Tokyo with Sousuke by her side? \n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)\n\nNotes:\n\n- Nominated for the 2020 Manga Taisho Award.\n\n- Winner of the 47th Kodansha Manga Award in the Best General Manga category in 2023.",
