  "description": "College graduates struggle to cope with the real world. Music offers refuge in this modern manga with an American attitude.\nMeiko Inoue is a recent college grad working as an office lady in a job she hates. Her boyfriend Naruo is permanently crashing at her apartment because his job as a freelance illustrator doesn't pay enough for rent. And her parents in the country keep sending her boxes of veggies that just rot in her fridge. Straddling the line between her years as a student and the rest of her life, Meiko struggles with the feeling that she's just not cut out to be a part of the real world.\n\n(Source: Viz Media)\n\nNotes:\n\n- Nominated for the Eisner Award for Best U.S. Edition of International Material - Japan and the Harvey Award for Best American Edition of Foreign Material.\n\n- Includes one extra chapter and one-shot \"Haru yo Koi (Awaiting Spring)\" first included in the October 2017 new Japanese edition.",
