Yasuda loves high school girls and makes no attempt to hide this either. However, he never actually touches any of the girls, just acts overly friendly towards them and overly cold towards the guys.

Any time he is with only male students, he constantly bemoans the fact, loudly asking why they, and not some girls, are there. He also does not tend to remember the names of his male students, saying that he has no need to learn useless information. Many of Yasuda's female students also like him as well, thinking he's a cool, young, good looking teacher who's kind to them. Many of them like to visit with him in the counseling room. Yasuda even went out of his way to tell [Kyouko Hori](https://anilist.co/character/66171) to keep her ‘chin up’, and his little known fact about him is that he’s into ‘flat-chested’ girls, in an attempt to cheer her up with ‘confidence’.",
