Izuku has since become All Might's closest pupil.\n\nIzuku is a very timid, reserved, and polite boy. Although initially portrayed as insecure, tearful, and vulnerable, Izuku gradually matures into a more confident and braver person. His infectious leadership skills, combined with his passion and strategic abilities, have turned Izuku into a central figure of Class 1-A. He is caring and emotional, never hesitating to help or rescue someone in danger, even if he knows that he might not be strong or otherwise qualified enough to do it.\n\nIzuku is extremely (and sometimes scarily) enthusiastic about topics related to heroes. His dream drives him to write down notes about everything he learns about heroes' Quirks and fighting capabilities. Thanks to this practice, Izuku has developed a great analytical mind and can form complex battle plans in a few seconds, factoring in the best ways he can utilize the Quirks of allies and enemies alike for his own advantage.\n\nIzuku's Quirk \"One For All\" was transferred to him from All Might. His Quirk allows him to stockpile an enormous amount of raw power, allowing him to significantly enhance all of his physical abilities to various boundless levels. This results in unbelievable levels of strength, speed, stamina, agility, and durability. Izuku can focus the stockpiled power into a single body part, or spread it across his entire body evenly, though, focusing the power in a single part puts a greater strain on that part of his body.",

High School.\n\nKatsuki is a crude, arrogant, short-tempered, and aggressive person, especially at the beginning of the series. Due to the constant praise of his abilities and powerful Quirk, Katsuki has developed a superiority complex, and because of that, he desires to be the first and best at everything. He loves to win above all else and cannot stand it when he doesn't, leading him to lose his already short temper if he achieves anything but a complete victory.\n\nKatsuki is not only very athletic and talented at fighting, but also very intelligent and extremely perceptive, capable of strategic planning and improvisation. Additionally, his grades are among the highest of his class. Katsuki also possesses surprising talent in other areas, such as cooking and music, even though he doesn't show a particular interest in them. Overall, Katsuki is considered a natural-born genius with the potential to be one of the best Pro Heroes.\n\nKatsuki's Quirk \"Explosion\" allows him to secrete nitroglycerin-like sweat from the palms of his hands and ignite it on command, allowing him to create strong explosions. The more Katsuki sweats, the stronger his explosions become. Not only can Katsuki use the explosions for attacking, he can also use them to propel himself and navigate through the air at high speeds, allowing him to fly at his opponents without giving them time to react, as well as evade incoming attacks, even while in the air. The shockwave from an explosion can even be used as a shield.",

High School, where he got in through official recommendations. He is the youngest son of the top hero Endeavor.\n\nShouto initially has a cold, aloof personality, which stemmed from his complicated family life. Focused and unemotional, Shouto preferred to keep things to himself instead of hanging out with others. After the events of the U.A. Sports Festival, however, he notably became more sociable and kinder than ever before. He even gained a sense of humor and would occasionally smile, although still retaining some fragments of his previous distant attitude and nonchalant demeanor. While usually quiet and reserved, Shouto initially possessed a moderate level of arrogance, which, combined with his solitary tendencies, sometimes made him take the initiative without considering the opinions of others.\n\nShouto's Quirk Half-Cold Half-Hot gives him the ability to generate ice from the right side of his body, and flames from his left side. Due to years of rejecting his father, Shouto has developed a habit of favoring ice, even when fire would be a better option. This grudge also caused him to have difficulty controlling his flames. If he overuses one element without utilizing the other, then his own body temperature will suffer.",

He was raised by his master, All For One, with the goal of killing All Might, and ultimately destroying the society he represents.\n\nTomura is a very twisted, malevolent, and maliciously warped young man, who is considered to be the polar opposite of Izuku Midoriya. He doesn't care for his or almost anyone else's life, having no qualms about performing evil deeds like murdering innocent people. Tomura was initially perceived to be a \"man-child\": arrogant, selfish, dependent, and demanding, becoming angry if things didn't go his way and likening reality to some sort of video game. Unlike his mentor, Tomura lacked subtlety, preferring to eliminate problems through force. Much like a child, Tomura seemed unable to cope with his own feelings, instead lashing out and abusing both others or himself, tearing at his own neck when he becomes frustrated. \n\nInitially, Tomura seemingly caused destruction just for the sake of it and felt directionless about the League's path forward after Stain's arrest. It would take a fateful meeting with Izuku in a mall for him to develop an epiphany and become aware of his true convictions: to crumble hero society through All Might's death.\n\nTomura's Quirk allows him to disintegrate whatever he touches with all five fingers. It will take effect whether the target is organic or not. The disintegration spreads quickly and will spread through the victim's whole body if they don't amputate the decaying body part. His Quirk can even spread beyond what he's touching, allowing him to disintegrate large groups of enemies instantly.\n\n(Source: My Hero Academia Wiki)",

He is shown to be rather clever, knowing just the right words to manipulate others into replying to his comments, allowing him to activate his Quirk. He does not mind doing something underhanded to claim victory in a fight. Due to having his Brainwashing Quirk perceived as evil throughout his life, Hitoshi has been somewhat feared by those aware of his power and has been discriminated against solely because of the Quirk he was born with. This persecution led him to become resentful of those who had Quirks more associated with hero work. Regardless of his drawbacks, however, Hitoshi desires to become a Pro Hero more than anything.\n\nHitoshi's Quirk Brainwashing allows him to put someone in a state where they are forced to obey whatever he commands. He can only activate this power when his target verbally responds to something he says. Brainwashing must be intentionally activated and will not take effect if Hitoshi doesn't want it to. Using a megaphone or anything that makes his voice artificial will not allow his Quirk to activate, as the said devices would transform his voice into an electronic signal.",

He was formerly [All Might](https://anilist.co/character/89224)'s sidekick and was considered to be the brains behind All Might's hero operation before opening his own hero agency. \n\nSir Nighteye is a lean but muscular man with a clean, well-kept appearance. Unlike most Pro Heroes, he seems to prefer plain office clothes (a plain white suit with gold buttons, a white dress shirt, and a red tie with white dots) instead of an elaborate hero costume. \n\nSir Nighteye maintains a stoic and intimidating presence, with a cold and sharp glare, but that is only the side of his personality that he shows in public. He greatly values humor and actually requires people to make him laugh before he acknowledes them. Nighteye believes that humor and energy are vital elements for the future of society and punishes subordinates that fail to display those qualities.\n\nIn chapter 161/episode 77: ~!Nighteye is hospitalized after sustaining grievous injuries during the fight against the Shie Hassaikai. While at the hospital, he is visited by Mirio, Izuku, and even All Might, reuniting the friends after a long time. After telling everyone to keep smiling to bring about a brighter future, Sir Nighteye passes away peacefully, with a smile on his face.!~",

Though not always the easiest to get along with, he sees the animals not as what they are, but rather as comrades.    Shiina is mostly known as the lunatic rabbit with no feelings for another, only when one of his friends are in danger. He shows his true love for animals when one of his friends is getting hurt or kidnapped most of the times or went in the trouble. Shiina doesn&#039;t listen to anyone, only to himself. Somehow his original body shows whenever he saves someone that is too close to him, which shows that the Ghost Rabbit gives him hints away to understand that, but he&#039;s a complete idiot that doesn&#039;t understand most of the things. In his childhood he was doing nonsense that causes him only trouble.",

He is very willing to do the less glamorous jobs, such as cleaning up trash and does not seem to think that these are negative aspects of being a hero or vigilante. \n\nHis costume consists of his regular clothes in conjunction with an All Might-haired hooded jacket, a black mask covering his face, red sunglasses, and protective bike gear.\n\nUnbeknownst to Koichi, he and Kazuho share a history. Koichi had once saved Kazuho when she fell into a river. He would give the drenched Kazuho his limited edition All Might hoodie and run off to his entrance exam for a high school that specialized in superheroics. Because he chose to save her, Koichi ended up missing the exam and returning to his hometown.\n\n~!After his battle against Number 6, he now possesses a scar on his left cheek, which he received from the villain shortly before his death. As \"The Skycrawler\", his hero costume is a blue full-body suit, akin to his traditional All Might hoodies and Number 6's \"O'Clock II\" costume, an updated version of his original gloves, and silver armored shoulder pads, also bearing a resemblance to Number 6's costume. He also wears a purple visor that resembles Captain Celebrity's, and has a utility belt over his waist with an \"SC\" on it.!~\n\n(Source: Wikia)",
