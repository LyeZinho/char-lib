Because of his fearsome appearance and odd habits he is widely mistaken to be a scary, bloodthirsty carnivore. Legoshi is wholly aware of this and does everything in his power to minimize himself and downplay his intimidating aspects. The series is largely about him coming to terms with his place in the world as a wolf.\n\nLegoshi develops some complicated feelings for the rabbit Haru.\n\n~!He is a 1/4 komodo dragon, because of his grandfather Gosha.!~",

After Tem was kind to Riz he thought could he go without taking his medication yet by doing so causing him to accidentally kill Tem. After he realized what he has done by eating Tem he developed a taste for killing causing him to slowly lose his sanity developing a twisted mentally where he believes Tem wanted to be eaten and eating Legoshi will cause them to become friends.
