He is married with Mitsuba Higashikata and has a son, Tsurugi. Beyond his job at the Higashikata Fruit Company, Jobin was formerly one of the members of the Rock Humans' Locacaca Organization. \n\nJobin desires the power of the Locacaca, wishing to obtain it to rid his family of the Higashikata curse. This desire leads to him valuing the Locacaca and elimination of any in his way above everything else, even being unconcerned if Morioh itself were to be destroyed in the process.\n\nJobin is a Stand User and wields the mysterious Speed King. Little is known about Speed King's abilities other than its primary ability to store heat and temperature within a short localized point. This power can be weaponized and used to heat people's blood vessels, boiling the blood inside to render them unconscious or even kill them- when applied to the temples the heat can become so damaging the victim's eyes burst. Speed King is shown to be physically able enough to rapidly pummel enemies. The Stand also has other hidden abilities that Jobin keeps undisclosed, even to his own family.\n\n~!He is later killed after seeing the Wonder of U user, Tooru staring at him. He was struck with a calamity by being shot to death by the dip tube of a spray that pierced his chest and instantly suffered from extreme blood loss.!~",
