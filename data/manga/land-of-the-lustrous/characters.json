They're weak, brittle - not suited for battle - and their clumsiness makes them difficult to maintain any roles, even though they've always wanted to be useful. Phos' initial job was to make a natural history encyclopedia which they progressed very little on. They promised to help [Cinnabar](https://anilist.co/character/123384/Cinnabar) find a job suited for them as well.\n\nPhos is a young, overconfident, clumsy, and naive gem, who is the only one capable of getting away with talking back to [Kongou](https://anilist.co/character/123394/Kongou). Many gems describe them as lazy and useless due to their fragility and incompetence, although Phos does display a drive to help Sensei and the others, often held back by their low hardness. There is an underlying way of how Phos acts and speaks about themselves that hints at them taking the “useless” and “lazy” comments to heart, and impacting their self-esteem. These facts indicate that Phos may have something of an inferiority complex. They settle with what they can do and constantly state that they will try better next time. Phos displays a change of personality over the course of the series, mainly due to maturing, trauma, and outside influences. This is mainly due to the fact that the gems are not equipped to deal with trauma.\n\nPhosphophyllite wears a standard winter uniform and black shoes without socks, occasionally accompanied by long black gloves. Phos has mint-green features known by the gems and the Admirabilis as the Lunarians' favorite color. Their hair is short, originally just beneath the ears, but cut shorter in later chapters to imitate [Antarcticite](https://anilist.co/character/124307/Antarcticite)'s hairstyle.",

Due to their body producing Mercury (which is harmful to Gems and living things), they are isolated and ashamed of themselves. They hate fighting and hate to be seen.\n\nAccording to [Rutile](https://anilist.co/character/123399/Rutile), Cinnabar has an extraordinary amount of talent and combat ability but is too much to handle due to their uncontrollable poison. Cinnabar's silver poison gathers faint light at night, which keeps them awake and aware while night patrolling. According to [Kongou](https://anilist.co/character/123394/Kongou), the night patrol is something Cinnabar came up with by themself. They used to spend their time during the day in Hollow Cape, waiting for the Lunarians to take them since they thought they may at least be of use to them. They are knowledgeable about things other gems don't know about.\n\n[Phosphophyllite](https://anilist.co/character/123385/Phosphophyllite) was recommended by the gems to see Cinnabar for the encyclopedia. After accidentally hearing their secret and wish, Phos promises to help Cinnabar find a job more suited to them than night patrol, saying, \"a fun job only you can do.\" When encountering Phos each time, Cinnabar seems doubtful of their words and outwardly annoyed with them, even going so far as to run away at one point. But they are the only gem they regularly speak to. Although they try not to show it, they have a tiny sliver of hope that Phos will be able to fulfill their promise.\n\nCinnabar is able to pull out an abundant amount of mercury. They're able to manipulate it in the air, from a distance, and around them, as some mercury droplets constantly hover around them. They seem to not be in full control over it and sometimes release it without wanting to. The mercury allows them to stay up during the night due to its reflective properties shining light. The mercury is dubbed \"liquid poison\" by the other gems. It's known to damage both organic life and the gems. Often with spills, the area becomes inhabitable for a long time afterward, often looking dead after later observation. In terms of the gems, the mercury is known to damage surfaces it's exposed to and causes light to be blocked from reaching those parts, requiring the pieces to be removed.\n\n(Source: Houseki no Kuni Wiki, edited)",

      "description": "**Hardness**: 6\n\nRutile is one of the gems and works as a doctor. They repair cracked or broken gems and handle the management of herbs, pastes, powders, and other medical remedies. Rutile is always found at work or sleeping on one of the sides of the halls surrounded by cupboards, boxes, and herbs. They are the partner of the unstable [Padparadscha](https://anilist.co/character/124485/Padparadscha), whose body is actively being maintained. Besides repairs, they are responsible for carrying out regular physical checkups and applying powder and saltwater resin to their bodies.\n\nRutile takes their job very seriously. They are known to stay up all night if needed to put a gem back together. As a result, they are often tired and known to take naps during the day. They have also been shown to be a bit eccentric and sarcastic, and to take great pride in their job and research, whether dissecting animals or studying the physical composition of gems' bodies. They don't take well to having their medical authority questioned. Even so, they still become easily embarrassed when pestered about things like love.\n\nAs the gem's doctor, Rutile is one of the more frequently seen characters who are more knowledgeable about the gems' health and bodies, often providing explanations for how they work. Rutile explains the nature of the gems and how they have microscopic organisms called inclusions within their bodies which allow them to move and make them basically immortal. They state that even if a gem is broken, ground to dust, and scattered into the bottom of the ocean, this is simply suspended animation and the gem could be revived if put back together.\n\nThey are very close to Padparadscha, their former partner, despite nowadays being unable to spend time with them. Hundreds of thousands of failed operations to fix them have not made them lose hope. They believe they cannot be called a doctor if they cannot solve Padparadscha's condition. They are extremely dedicated, bordering on obsessed with this task.\n\n~!Rutile's mental state was broken after losing Padparadscha. They have become more impulsive and feral in nature, their hair unkempt and falling straight down. Seeing Padparadscha whole and awake seemed to be unchanging of this nature, as Rutile attempts to attack Padparadscha along with [Phosphophyllite](https://anilist.co/character/123385/Phosphophyllite) and [Yellow Diamond](https://anilist.co/character/123400/Yellow-Diamond). This has lead to Rutile becoming unable. When Padparadscha returned themself, Rutile clung onto the piece of Padparadscha that was given as a \"gift\" to repair them.!~\n\n(Source: Houseki no Kuni Wiki, edited)",
