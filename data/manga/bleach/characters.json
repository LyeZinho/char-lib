But, more importantly, he's a Substitute Soul Reaper.\n\nEver since he was young, Ichigo has been able to see spirits, to the point where he could not tell the living from the dead. Due to this oddity, he would end up meeting [Rukia Kuchiki](https://anilist.co/character/6/Rukia-Kuchiki), a Soul Reaper. Soon after, once a hollow appeared and threatened his family, he recklessly fought back against it, forcing Rukia to save him by taking the blow of it's attack. Seeing Ichigo's determination to protect his family, Rukia offered to temporarily turn him into a Soul Reaper by piercing his chest with her Zanpakutou and transferring half of her power to him. Ichigo goes through with it, allowing him to make short work of the Hollow, and forcing him to fulfill Rukia's role as a Soul Reaper until she can regain her powers.\n\nBeing stubborn, short-tempered, strong-willed, and impulsive, Ichigo often claims not to care about what other people think about him, and attempts to maintain a detached and \"cool\" image. He generally keeps his face set in a near-permanent scowl, with his eyebrows drawn together. His outspoken, hot-headed demeanor is a trait Ichigo himself has acknowledged, and if somebody picks a fight with him, he cannot help fighting back. Ichigo's resolve in battle can waver at times, which can impede his fighting prowess, and he tends to go into a state of depression and self-loathing when he loses a major fight or lets a friend down. Despite what he lets on, he is genuinely compassionate and empathetic towards others, and doesn't mind helping others when they become upset, or need the support. He is always willing to fight to protect those he cares for, no matter what it is he would be fighting against.",

She is graceful and \"clean\", yet is willing to talk to ordinary people. However, her cool and lone demeanor often forces her to hide her personal troubles, even from those close to her. Because of her never opening up her heart, she has difficulty making friends. She can also act like a bit of a tomboy at times, wanting to show others that she's tough and getting aggressive towards others when they insult her. Rukia is clueless about the ways of the modern Human World, often making misconceptions and struggling with the simplest of things like opening a juice box. She likes to climb up to high places and loves everything rabbit-themed, becoming quite sensitive when someone insults her obsession with them. People often have difficulty understanding her drawings, which are typically rabbit-like, and doesn't like it when people complain about their quality.",

She comes off as naive and rather clueless, which is at odds with her exceptionally high marks in school. Although, apparently she is hopeless when it comes to technology. She is also notorious for cooking up and eating strange food at home, although she also likes some normal food. Her favorite food is red bean paste, and she likes putting butter on sweet potatoes. Orihime has a tendency to rush into situations without thinking, sometimes leading to embarrassing consequences, plus she has an overactive imagination and can get carried away thinking of implausible scenarios. Orihime has also demonstrated that she is perceptive, mostly when it comes to Ichigo Kurosaki, who she is deeply in love with. \n\nPreviously, she had lived with her older brother, [Sora](https://anilist.co/character/27739/Sora-Inoue), who was fifteen years older than her. She and her brother were raised by a drunk father and an unfaithful mother, who always argued and beat their children. It is unknown if her parents are still alive. When Sora turned eighteen, he ran away with Orihime, who was three years old, and raised her since. For six years, Orihime and Sora lived in harmony despite the fact that Orihime was bullied in school because of her long hair. One day, Sora gave Orihime a pair of hairpins. However, Orihime refused to wear them because she said they were childish. On the same day, Sora was wounded in a car accident and died in the Kurosaki clinic. Orihime has worn the hairpins ever since. A year after Sora died, Orihime met [Tatsuki Arisawa](https://anilist.co/character/1094/Tatsuki-Arisawa) who defended her from the bullies. They have been best friends ever since.",

Uryuu operates on a moral ethic known as the \"Pride of the Quincy\" and has a strong sense of justice. He has also shown to be very chivalrous, stating that he enacts justice on men who abuse or treat women badly. Uryuu also has a tendency to not use lethal force in battle, especially if he can win without doing so. Instead, he will simply incapacitate his opponent.  Uryuu does not hold his father, Ryuuken Ishida, in high respect; he calls his father by his given name which is considered very rude in Japanese society\n\nHis favorite food is homemade mackerel miso stew.

Nonetheless, he is treated equally within his group of friends in Karakura (Ichigo, Keigo and Mizuiro). Chad also has a weakness for cute things, like small animals and Kon, and is one of the few characters that actually treats Kon with any dignity but for the most part ignores him. To match his extraordinary size, Chad possesses extraordinary superhuman durability, even before activating his spiritual powers, being able to survive the impact of a falling steel girder on his back and a head-on motorcycle collision, and is strong enough to break telephone poles and wield them as giant clubs, even when already injured. Besides his physical strength, Chad has also shown to be very intelligent; he ranked 10th out of 322 in school, while Ichigo ranked 23rd.",

In terms of personality, Renji is same as any other Shinigami. His personality varies from cocky and eccentric, to being depressed after he's defeated, all the way to being clueless and funny. Although he's carefree and happy character in most of the series, he can be quite serious, especially when it's the matter of life and death situations for either him or people he hold precious.  He is shown to have rather complicated relationship with his captain, Kuchiki Byakuya. Renji sees Byakuya as the goal he has to surpass. First time, when Renji was still in the Academy, he encountered Byakuya and felt something chilling about him. In the meantime, Renji became Byakuya's lieutenant, and throughout the series, Renji starts to see Byakuya not only as rival, but also as man he can look up to.",

Her most distinctive features are her very large breasts, which are even larger than Orihime Inoue's. She also shares Orihime's strange taste in food. She dresses in the garb typical of shinigami, though her robes hang loose enough for her ample bosom to be revealed. She wears a necklace and a pink scarf over her shoulders. In addition, her lieutenant's armband is worn on her uniform's sash, as opposed to around the arm.  Rangiku tends to be a slacker who doesn't like paperwork and loves to drink saké. She's not the least bit modest about her appearance, frequently referring or complaining about her large breasts in casual conversation. She even tries to bribe Ichigo Kurosaki into letting her stay at his house using them, though unsuccessfully. Her easy-going and free-spirited personality is in sharp contrast with the serious Hitsugaya, but the two seem to be quite close, regardless. Rangiku is almost constantly by his side and has shown her loyalty to him on several occasions. While she seems somewhat self-centered, she is sensitive to the feelings of others, evident when she sees the concern Hitsugaya has for Momo Hinamori, the guilt Izuru Kira shares with her when Gin Ichimaru is revealed as a traitor, and when Orihime feels depressed about her role in Ichigo Kurosaki's life. Despite her lackadaisical image, she can be extremely serious when needed. She's shown to be somewhat maternal, especially with Orihime and Momo.   ~!Not much is mentioned about Rangiku's past. She came from Rukongai and was rescued as a child by Gin Ichimaru; the two soon became friends. In one short chapter from the manga, she was once asked by Ichimaru during her childhood when her birthday was. She replied that she did not know because she had been alone for as far as she could remember. This possibly means she was orphaned since birth. When he heard about this, Ichimaru told her that if this was the case, then her birthday should be set on the day they met (the day she was not alone anymore).  It is not known how she became a shinigami or how she became lieutenant of the 10th Division, but it is known that she has held the position longer than her current captain has held his. She first met Hitsugaya in Rukongai when the two bumped into one another. Recognizing his immense power, and the harm it was causing to the old woman he lived with, she convinced him to become a shinigami in order to control it.!~",

She is a hard worker and takes a strong moral stand — she particularly believes in following orders. She is generally reserved and not arrogant like her lieutenant. She will not hesitate in the slightest to strike down even her subordinates if they stand in her way. Soi Fon, like most female shinigami, is a member of the Shinigami Women's Association.   Underneath her standard shinigami captain uniform, Soi Fon wears the special forces leader's uniform, which has no sleeves or covering for the back. The reason the shoulders and the back are exposed is because of Soi Fon's ability to use shunkō (flash cry), an advanced technique that combines hand to hand combat and kidō and causes high spiritual pressure to accumulate at the shoulders and back, blasting away the fabric at the shoulders and back. Her hair is worn short with two long braids covered in cloth.   Long ago, she had a close friendship with Yoruichi Shihouin that went beyond the typical leader/subordinate relationship. When Youruichi left the soul society with no explanation, Soi Fon took it as a personal betrayal of her feelings, with gives rise to her intense hatred of anyone who disobeys orders or disturbs the harmony of the soul society. She finally comes to terms with her feelings toward Yoruichi during the \"Rukia Rescue\" arc, and the two becomes friends again soon after. Soi Fon has borderline romantic feelings toward Yoruichi which becomes evident on several occasions such as when she buys some photos of Yoroichi eating voraciously in skimpy clothing.  Soi Fon also has a personal dislike for Kisuke Urahara because of his close relationship with Yuruichi. Another person she dislikes is her own lieutenant, Oomaeda, whom she punches quite frequently for his stupidity and cowardice.  The correct romanization of her name, as confirmed by Kubo Tite, is Suì-Fēng.",

In spite of his icy and regal manner, Byakuya still cares for and protects those important to him.\n\nByakuya strongly believes in law and order. As a captain of the Gotei 13 and head of one of the great noble families, he works hard for a peaceful society. He feels that if someone in his position does not follow the rules as a good example, no one else will. He believes that to maintain the order, all lawbreakers must be punished, even if it goes against his own wishes.",

District #80 is the worst, most lawless region of Rukongai, full of thieves and murderers (whereas area #1 is the most orderly and law-abiding). While residing in District #80, Kenpachi was nameless. During that time, he became proficient in swordsmanship and killed numerous enemies. At some point during his travels outside of District #80, he found a small girl and named her Yachiru, in remembrance of the only person he ever admired, after she showed no fear of his sword. Yachiru came from area #79, Kusajishi, where her parents were murdered. The two events were apparently quite close. On that day, he also took on a name: Kenpachi, the title bestowed upon the strongest swordsman, the one who has killed the most. The two developed a father-daughter-like relationship.\n\nAlso, at some point (before he became a Captain), he fought and defeated Ikkaku Madarame; for this reason, Ikkaku pledged to serve under Kenpachi from there on out (Ikkaku doesn't actually get the chance to do so until he joins the 11th Division), but Ikkaku would still jump at the chance to fight Kenpachi to the death. After some time had passed, Kenpachi found his way to the Seireitei. He defeated and killed the previous Captain of the 11th Division (whose identity is currently unknown) and gained his seat in the Gotei 13 in this manner. In the anime, his assumption of the Captain's seat caused Maki Ichinose to leave the Soul Society. According to the anime, it is also what convinced Ikkaku and Yumichika to join the Shinigami.",

The spirit of Zangetsu resembles a 30 to 40 year-old man, and Ichigo calls him \"old man\" as a result. \n\nZangetsu is portrayed as wise and calm in most matters, and fond of testing Ichigo in unusual ways, many of which have a purpose completely contrary to the stated goal. Zangetsu has displayed the ability to temporarily close fatal wounds during combat, though whether or not this is a unique ability is unclear. Unlike most zanpakuto, Zangetsu has no release command. The shikai form of Zangetsu resembles an over sized, though more elegant, cleaver blade without a hilt guard. The sword is as tall as Ichigo is, 1.74 meters, and has a black blade with a silver edge. When not in combat, the cloth extends to cover the rest of the sword and falls away when necessary, shrinking back to a manageable size. The cloth can also be used to swing the weapon like a flail and toss it at opponents, but this is rarely done. \n\nThe bankai of Zangetsu, named Tensa Zangetsu (天鎖斬月, lit. heavenly chained cutting moon), is considered completely out of the ordinary for any zanpakutō. Unlike most bankai forms, which usually create some sort of massive creature or effect, Ichigo's bankai actually shrinks his sword down to a daitō (Japanese long sword) with a black blade, handguard in the shape of the manji (which is the kanji for \"ban,\" meaning \"full\"). The cloth wrapped around the hilt is replaced by a short chain with a broken link, similar to that of a plus spirit. In addition to his sword, Ichigo's robe is replaced with a long-sleeved, ankle-length black coat with red lining that is closed at his chest, much like that of Zangetsu himself.    ~!When Ichigo enters the zanpakutō realm while it is in bankai, the spirit of Zangetsu seems much younger, around Ichigo's age. !~ Zangetsu's special ability (in either form) is the getsuga tenshō (月牙天衝, lit. moon fang heaven stab, Viz: Moon-Fang Piercer of the Heavens), which fires concentrated energy blasts from the tip of the blade in the shape of a crescent moon.",

Ulquiorra is also analytical; during his and Yammy's first visit to the human world, he makes several remarks on the humans who confront them. He theorizes that Orihime Inoue's healing power is a temporal-spatial ability, which Aizen describes as the rejection of fate, and comments on how Ichigo Kurosaki's final release can easily get through Yammy's defenses. He also notes Ichigo's power fluctuation, which varies between very weak and stronger than his own. It would appear that Ulquiorra and Grimmjow, the 6th Espada, are not on good terms. While Ulquiorra allowed Yammy to kill anyone he deemed as \"trash\", which included Ichigo, Ulquiorra allowed him to live based on his belief that Ichigo's power was so turbulent that eventually, he would destroy himself. Grimmjow's conflicting viewpoint was that Ichigo should have been destroyed outright, as he could overcome his weakness and grow even stronger. \n\nDespite Grimmjow's argument, Aizen trusted Ulquiorra's judgment. This disagreement led to Grimmjow's unauthorized assault on the real world. Though Ulquiorra is of a higher rank than Grimmjow, Grimmjow is confident that Ulquiorra is afraid to fight him for fear of them destroying one another. When released his zanpakutō, Murciélago (黒翼大魔 (ムルシエラゴ) ,Murushierago?, Japanese for \"giant black-winged demon,\" Spanish for \"bat\") creates two large black wings on his back. His hollow helmet centers atop his head, sporting two large horns, and his arrancar uniform appears more form fitting at the top, becoming robe-like towards the bottom. Additionally, Ulquiorra is apparently unique among the Espada in that he has a second release; Resurrección Segunda Etapa (Spanish for \"resurrection second stage\"). He becomes more muscular with clawed hands and feet, the whites of his eyes turn black, and his helmet is replaced with elongated horns. He loses his clothes; his arms and legs from the hip down are covered in black fur, and he gains a long thin tail. In both forms he can create long \"lances\" of energy called Lanza del Relámpago (雷霆の 槍(ラソサ・デ ル ・レ ラソ パ ー ゴ ) ,ransa deru reranpāgo?, Japanese and Spanish for ”lance of the lightning”), and when thrown can cause an explosion. Ulquiorra seems unfamiliar with the technique when he uses it in his second release state, unexpectedly missing Ichigo with his first one, however, to compensate, he can produce more should his first miss the target.

Wonderweiss is small, thin, and somewhat child-like. What is left of his hollow mask remains on top of his head, and resembles a tiara or small crown. Wonderweiss's personality is also child-like and even autistic. When sent on a mission to kill, he instead plays around with a dragonfly. He shows a bit of hostility, firing a retaliatory bala blast at one point, but quickly reverts back to his regular state after doing so. He isn't able to speak clearly, only saying a few syllables at a time like a child would. Kaname Tōsen says that Wonderweiss, like himself, is a pure being (though he makes a point of wondering whether he is pure good or evil), which often tend to stick together, causing Wonderweiss to follow him everywhere when possible. Also for this reason, he tried to restrain Gin Ichimaru from getting closer to Tōsen, since Wonderweiss was wary of him.  Wonderweiss's zanpakutō is a large purple sword strapped to his back, about as tall as he is. The hilt resembles a western long sword rather than the more common katana, although the familiar hilt weaving is present, whilst the guard resembles an Egyptian eye. The name and released state of his zanpakutō have not been revealed.   ~!It is revealed in the \"Fake Karakura Town\" arc that Wonderweiss is a so-called \"modified arancar\", and that he was specifically created for the sole function of sealing Ryuujin Jakka's flames.

He was revealed as a co-conspirator working for Sousuke Aizen and left Soul Society along with him and Gin Ichimaru. He then became a Commander in Aizen's Army of Arrancar. The Soul Society ordeal put him at odds with his formerly closest friend Sajin Komamura, as well as his former Lieutenant in the 9th Division, Shuuhei Hisagi.    Tousen&#039;s creed in life is to &quot;take the path with the least bloodshed&quot;; it was for this reason that he felt it necessary to follow Sousuke Aizen. Despite this, he knows of Aizen&#039;s plan to create the King&#039;s Key, which will require the deaths of thousands of innocent people. He was also willing to attack and kill members of his own division while acting as the 5th seat, including Hollowfying his own captain. Tousen, along with Gin Ichimaru was identified by Kenpachi Zaraki as being afraid of death, this is later confirmed with him saying he only feared being assimilated into the Shinigami culture and dying a pointless death. His own description of himself as a &quot;pure being&quot; when explaining why Wonderweiss Margela likes him shows degrees of pride and arrogance as well. Also, despite stating many times how much his friend loved the world, he himself never said so, and in fact hated the world that took away his friend. As Captain of the 9th Division, which is charged with the editing of Seireitei Communication, Tousen was the chief editor of the journal. He himself wrote a serialization titled &quot;The Path of Justice&quot;, which was not very popular, until he began to publish cooking recipes in his articles, which made them more popular among female Shinigami. This also indicates that his speciality is indeed cooking, his favorite dishes being chicken stewed with carrots and other sophisticated ones. He does not like pickled food. Tousen also has several unique relationships with the Arrancars. Tousen thinks of Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez in the same manner as Kenpachi Zaraki; a killing machine that will cause only more bloodshed in the world. Wonderweiss Margera seems to have a great affection towards him. Tousen explains that this is because they are both pure spirits, and that pure spirits tend to attract and follow each other. !~",

      "description": "__Height:__ 192cm (6'3\")\n__Rank:__ Captain of the 8th Division ~!Later, Captain-Commander, Captain of the 1st Division!~  \n\nKyoraku is a laid back and flamboyant man, evident in his style of dress and general attitude. He wears a straw hat and a pink flowered haori over his captain's uniform. Although his haori and obi sash are cheap, his pinwheel hairpin is very expensive. In his off time, he can be seen drinking sake and napping. Other times, he likes to chase after women, which is noted by Yasochika Iemura of the 4th Squad when commenting in his diary. In particular, he often flirts with his lieutenant, Nanao Ise, whom he calls 'my Nanao-chan' (little Nanao).\n\nHe is close friends with 13th Division Captain Jushiro Ukitake, with whom he graduated from the shinigami academy and works with often.  Kyoraku tends to use a more familiar speech style than most other characters in Bleach. He generally refers to his fellow captains and shinigami by their first name followed by an honorific, and is the only character who dispenses with honorifics when addressing General Yamamoto, calling him old Yama (Yama-jī). Even Ukitake, who was also taught by Yamamoto, does not do this.\n\nKyoraku is a peace-loving man who will always try to talk his way out of a fight. However, he does not wish to insult his opponents by not fighting, either, as he explains to Chad. Since he has achieved the rank of captain, it is implied that he must be a powerful fighter, but the true extent of his abilities has not been seen in the anime. General Yamamoto states that Kyoraku and Jushiro Ukitake, both of whom he trained himself, possess \"greater powers on the battlefield than any younger generation, or old,\" suggesting that the two are more powerful than any other captains, with the possible exception of Yamamoto himself.  The slightly eccentric Kyoraku also seems to like making an impression on opponents.\n\n ~!After Shigekuni Yamamoto-Genryuusai died, Jirou Souzousa Shunsui became the captain of the 1st division.!~",

      "description": "Kon primarily serves as a comedic foil in the series; when not inhabiting Ichigo's body, his normal plushie body is treated with little respect and much disdain. The humorously cruel treatment he is always subjected to provides the comic relief in Bleach. One of the only people who gives him any respect is Chad; however, Chad ignores him most of the time. His plushie body is a knock-off of the main character of the popular TV show Carnivore Kingdom, named \"Ponkichi\", which happens to be Chad's favorite show. It was a prize from the shooting game in the Karakura Town Festival.[2] He is constantly stepped on and torn, at which point Ichigo will have Uryū Ishida repair the plushie. Uryū usually adds something unwanted or unnecessary when doing so, such as dressing Kon up like a designer doll. Uryū also sewed a Quincy cross on the back of Kon's head as revenge after Kon attacked Uryū for turning him into a doll.  Kon is quite perverted and often takes advantage of his form to get girls to hug him to their chests, which rarely goes as planned. After Ichigo becomes less dependent on Kon to transform, Kon comments on how he wouldn't mind taking Ichigo's body out for a spin again, saying that he'd like go peeping and pulling up skirts because, as he puts it, \"It's [Ichigo's] reputation that gets sullied\". Kon is very fond of Rukia, calling her \"sister\", though this extends to basically any pretty girl.  Kon is a special type of soul pill called a \"modified soul\" or \"ModSoul\". When inserted into a body, an aspect of the body is made superhuman, which in Kon's case is enhanced speed and strength. Because of the shady origins of the ModSoul, the soul society called for the destruction of all ModSoul pills, but luckily, Kon was shipped out with a load of regular soul pills by mistake. This gives rise to his belief that everyone should be given a chance at life and should not be killed merely based on the circumstances of their origins.  His name \"Kon\" comes from the word \"ModSoul Konpaku\", another name for \"modified soul\". Though Kon wanted his name to be \"Mod\", Ichigo disagreed for the same reason that Kon liked it, it sounded too cool.  Theme songs: \"Nichiyoubi Dansu\" by Kuuki Koudan (Kon Theme #1) and \"Bushman\" by Rip Slyme (Kon Theme #2)",

Ganju&#039;s boar is named Bonnie (affectionately referred to as Bonnie-chan). The omake sketch after episode 114 implies that Bonnie was accidentally cooked into a stew by Retsu Unohana during a friendly cookout including her, Ganju, and a few others from the 4th Division. Similar sketches have occurred in the series, but Bonnie is always shown alive and well by the next episode. Ganju possesses a deep hatred for shinigami, a hot temper, and a strong ego. Though he always acts tough, he has shown that he also has a softer side, easily being cowed by his older sister Kūkaku, and later develops an understanding to Ichigo Kurosaki with a relationship similar to Ichigo and Renji Abarai&#039;s. The fact that he is not particularly attractive is a running joke in the series, and rather than deny this fact he tends to talk around the subject, especially when Yumichika Ayasegawa makes note of it.    Because of his brother&#039;s, Kaien Shiba, death at the hands of Rukia Kuchiki when he was still young, Ganju holds a grudge against all shinigami. This grudge is slow to dissipate even after he learns the truth of the incident. It is implied that after Kaien and his wife Miyako&#039;s death, the Shiba clan lost its status as one of the Noble Clans (which include the Kuchiki and Shihouin clans). There now remain only four Noble Clans, as the Shiba had been the fifth. Upon Ganju&#039;s introduction, he and Kūkaku are the only remaining members of the clan.    Though Ganju is not a member of the shinigami forces, he is of the Shiba clan and can fight on a level above that of an average shinigami, but lower than that of the higher ranking seated officers. He has a zanpakutō which resembles a meat cleaver or a Chinese Dadao, though he never demonstrates the ability to use its initial release. Ganju&#039;s sword skills are limited, so he relies primarily on his arsenal of fireworks, his agility, and his earth magic. Ganju&#039;s earth magic doesn&#039;t seem to operate on the same principle as standard shinigami kidō. The one technique he uses, Stone Wave (石波, seppa?), doesn&#039;t need an incantation to work and is unnumbered. The spell can reduce whatever it is aimed at to sand or quicksand. He can even perform it with his feet. This ability proved to be useful to make holes through the walls when running away from Yumichika.    Source: Wikipedia",

Hinamori is generally quite trusting, but also very impulsive and naïve. She greatly admires her former captain, Sōsuke Aizen, whom she became a shinigami just to serve under, and Hinamori refuses believing that Aizen intentionally betrayed Soul Society. Her appearance is fairly ordinary compared to other shinigami in Soul Society. She wears her hair up in a bun with a cloth wrapped around it. According to Tite Kubo, Hinamori's name was changed at the last minute; she had a completely different name in the sketch stage.  Hinamori grew up in Junrinan, District 1 of Rukongai, along with Tōshirō Hitsugaya. While Hitsugaya tended to be a bit of a brat as a child and insisted that he would protect her, Hinamori found him amusing and treated him in an older sisterly fashion, and the two became close friends, with Hinamori giving him the nickname Shiro-chan (little Shiro in English Anime). When Hinamori entered the shinigami academy, she excelled at kidō. It was there that she met Kira and Renji, who soon became her friends and, later, her fellow lieutenants. They were placed in the 5th Division of the Gotei 13 under Captain Aizen and his lieutenant, Gin Ichimaru. While Kira and Renji would later leave to other Divisions, Hinamori remained in the 5th Division and became the division's lieutenant (through much hard work, as noted by Hitsugaya). \n\nHinamori's zanpakutō is Tobiume (飛梅, lit. flying plum tree). The command for its shikai is \"snap\" (弾け, hajike?). [Her zanpakuto is a kido type] It's Shi-kai form is like a rod with branches  Shikai Special Ability: In this form, Tobiume acts as a focus for Momo's spiritual power, concentrating it into energy bursts capable of cratering floors and breaching walls.

While in the Shinigami Academy, Kira befriended Momo Hinamori, Renji Abarai, and Shūhei Hisagi, and they were often seen spending time together. After graduation, Kira, along with Renji and Momo, was sent to the 5th Division, where he stayed until Gin Ichimaru became Captain of the 3rd Division. Kira is loyal to both his friends and his duties, perhaps to a fault. Despite the close friendship he shares with Momo Hinamori, Kira shows that his loyalty knows no boundaries when he defends his captain while she is in a grief-induced rage from her own Captain's apparent death. Despite this, he calls himself a \"monster\" afterwards for raising his sword against her.  Kira's Zanpakutō is Wabisuke. Its Shikai command is \"Raise your head.\" When activated, Wabisuke's Shikai bends the blade into a square hook. In this form, Wabisuke doubles the weight of whatever it strikes. The ability affects both inanimate objects and living beings. Though a seemingly pointless ability in sword combat, the effect is cumulative. With a second hit from Wabisuke, the weight will double again and so on, exponentially. Thus, after seven or eight blocked attacks, his opponents are unable to lift their own swords. Once Wabisuke's effect becomes noticeable, Kira's opponents often fall to their knees with their heads bent down, as if in apology, thus the name of Kira's Zanpakutō.",

What remains of his Hollow mask is a bulky helmet similar in shape to a hammerhead shark. The right-hand side of his mask is wrapped in bandages, which obscures his right eye (the bandages are meant to hide an injury given to him by Grimmjow when he was still an Adjuchas). When the bandages are unwrapped, there is a gash on the top of his mask. His right eye is identical to a normal Hollow eye; a white circle surrounded by black shadows. He has square, shark-like teeth (his oddly shaped teeth have been noted to give him a slight lisp). Di Roy is noted for carrying his Zanpakutō in his hands for much of his screentime. Di Roy's original Hollow form was that of a snake-like creature with a shark head matching the remnants of his mask.    During his battle with Rukia Kuchiki, he claims that his &quot;true battlefield is in the sky,&quot; suggesting that he fights better in the air; however, most Arrancar seem to prefer this method of fighting. Di Roy is apparently weaker than his brethren (a direct result of Grimmjow eating part of him as an Adjuchas, thus halting his development early), to the point that Yylfordt Granz scornfully refers to him as an &quot;Arrancar in name only.&quot; He apparently had to beg the rest of the group to allow him to partake in the invasion.",

After a while found a powerful Adjucha called Grimmjoww Jaggerjack shaped panther that achieves wounding D-Roy before this can even attack, Shawlong as leader kneels before Grimmjow (is followed by all others) and requests him to be their king, and that under his leadership achieved become the most powerful class of Less, Vastoroodes.  After some time hunting and predation of hollows, Ilforte and others realize that their developments has stopped eating after more than 3000 hollows, all realize this, Ilforte notes that after the hollow number 1000 power ceased to increase, except Grimmjow that does not seem ready to leave and disdained by cowards, Shawlong asks then they eat to halt its development and thus avoid retreat in the evolutionary scale, Grimmjow accessed.  II.First Appearance in Bleach  Ilforte Grantz is a sarcastic, effeminate arrancar with long blond hair. What remains of his hollow mask is on the top of his head, and looks like a broken helmet. He commonly refers to other characters as \"brother\" when speaking. He was the older brother of Szayel Aporro Granz, the 8th Espada. Ilforte fairly is powerful for his rank, able to fight off Renji Abarai's bankai (at 20% power) without releasing his zanpakuto. In contrast, however, he is little match for the surprisingly strong Ururu Tsumugiya in his normal state, but easily dispatches her once he releases his zanpakutō. He is eventually killed by Renji, who notes that if Ilforte hadn't been distracted, he might have been able to defeat him.  III.His Zanpakuto  Ilforte's zanpakuto is named Del Toro (Spanish for \"of the bull,\" Japanese for \"pale-horned prince\") and is released by the phrase \"skewer\"). When Del Toro is released, Ilforte's upper body enlarges and is covered in bull-like armor, while his mask seems to completely regenerate, giving him horns. In this form, he walks on four legs and uses his horns to skewer opponents.   _Source: Bleach official character book II_",

Arrancar numbered 11 and above are numbered in the order of their birth, then the top 10 are removed, given numbers 1-10, and called Espada. Therefore, the true extent of his power is unknown, it is simply known that he is not one of the ten most powerful arrancar.      Shawlong is unique in the arrancar we have seen so far, as he seems to be highly intelligent. He acts in a manner that implies he is the next in command to Grimmjow, during their assault on the material world. He seems to have been a major influence on the idea to go to the material world in the first place, judging by statements made during Grimmjow's argument with Ulquiorra. He claimed that if someone is not worth killing, it is also meaningless to let them live; fueling Grimmjow's argument that Uliquiora should have just killed Ichigo Kurosaki.",

Kaien, a very ethical man, was adored by many of the 13th Division members. He was outspoken and bore a rough disposition, but his down-to-earth attitude was one of the reasons why everyone looked up to him. Kaien treated his fellow company members indiscriminately, regardless of their social standing or rank. Because of this, he was popular among aristocrats and commoners alike within his Division.    He was the first person in Seireitei to treat Rukia like an ordinary person since her adoption into the Kuchiki family. Until he came along, she was treated with careful respect to her face and talked about and bashed behind her back. She was grateful for the fact that Kaien treated her as an equal, and it has been hinted that Rukia may have come to develop romantic feelings for him because of this. She didn&rsquo;t pursue him because Kaien was already married to the third seat of the 13th Division, Miyako Shiba.    Kaien believed that one&#039;s &quot;heart&quot; was determined based on the prospects of fighting and protecting. He was a firm believer in Captain Ukitake&#039;s policy on fighting, which consists of two types of combat: 1) The fight to protect life, and 2) The fight to protect honor. Kaien took it a step further and believed they both end up being the same thing: &quot;Heart.&quot; He believed that every time one connected with another, a little bit of &quot;heart&quot; is born between them. He thought of &quot;heart&quot; as not something inside you, but rather what is born whenever you think of, or remember, someone else. He believed that one&#039;s &quot;heart&quot; exists in others, and that it remains with his or her comrades even after death. Having held such views, he believed that people should never die alone. Kaien&#039;s favorite food was ohagi, and he liked to take afternoon naps if he could.",

Isshin also seems to enjoy making fun of Ichigo and has a tendency to talk to the large memorial poster of his late wife Masaki, which he has pinned up in their kitchen, whenever he feels particularly emotional. Isshin is a big fan of Don Kanonji&#039;s TV show. Despite his outrageous guise, however, Isshin can be serious and grim at times. On the date of Masaki&#039;s death, Isshin smokes a single cigarette in front of her grave, since she thought it made him look cool (she said it when they were dating). He reflects that it was the first and last time she ever complimented his appearance. He also told Ichigo that he shouldn&#039;t blame himself for his mother&#039;s death because she gave her life to protect him. \n\n~!In addition, during his confrontation with the arrancar Grand Fisher and the subsequent chat with Kisuke Urahara, he remains completely serious (aside from a short argument between him and Kon about his parenting, and another, albeit short, between him and Urahara after the latter likens him to his son). Isshin appears to be an associate of Kisuke Urahara and possesses knowledge of Sōsuke Aizen&#039;s alliance with the Menos. He mentions in his conversation with Urahara that he encountered arrancar about ten years before the main storyline, though they were nowhere near as complete as Fisher. He also reveals to Kon that he has been aware of Ichigo&#039;s shinigami activities and Kon&#039;s substitutions since Grand Fisher&#039;s first attack. He also notes that he has never called Kon &quot;Ichigo&quot; while Kon is in Ichigo&#039;s body and that the traveling charm he gave Ichigo before he went to rescue Rukia was actually for Kon (it&#039;s a protection talisman). This shows the sensitivity and propriety that he possesses of his role as Ichigo&#039;s father, which is rarely portrayed in the series. Isshin also shares a relationship with Ryūken Ishida not unlike that of their sons. When Ryūken discovers his son is missing, Isshin pays him a visit and the two chat about their respective styles of parenting. It is then revealed that Ryūken was aware of Isshin&#039;s status, and he comments on Isshin&#039;s powers. The Bleach Official Animation Book VIBEs states that the two have some prior history together, and that they have been acquaintances for quite some time. It can also be noted they both are doctors, Isshin runs a clinic while Ryūken runs a hospital. There have been hints that the two cooperate on a professional level, with Isshin handling minor cases, and occasionally requesting aid from Ryūken.!~",

Nemu is the artificially created daughter of Mayuri Kurotsuchi, a combination of his research in artificial bodie  and artificial souls. This past has driven her to become rather introverted and melancholic, preferring to stay silent in her captain&#039;s presence. Their relationship is far from the average father-daughter one, as Mayuri doesn&#039;t seem to care much for Nemu&#039;s well-being (using her as bait in combat). The most that can be said in his favor is that he has occasionally implied concern over her life as a point of personal pride in his own skill as her creator. Despite being abused and mistreated in every possible way by her captain and father, Nemu still shows great loyalty to him, and has openly expressed worry at the prospect of his death, likely due to her implied gratitude that Kurotsuchi brought her into the world. Unlike her father, however, she seems to have compassion for others, saving Uryū Ishida&#039;s life as a thank you for not killing Mayuri. Based on the 13 squad episode endings and the Bount arc, Nemu&#039;s fighting style seems to be a combination of capoeira-like martial arts, and kidō attacks.    Nemu&#039;s body was designed to withstand fatal injury, though still suffers the pain brought on by her injuries. This extends to being able to survive impregnation by Szayel Aporro Granz, a process meant to bring him back to life while leaving his host as an empty husk. Mayuri can repair Nemu very quickly in these situations, allowing her to continue doing her father&#039;s bidding. Nemu is also immune to Mayuri&#039;s many poisons. Despite this, she carries around a variety of antidotes to be used as she sees fit. She also holds various poisons and potions derived from Mayuri&#039;s research in her own body, making her highly dangerous to those that attack her internally. Nemu does not normally carry a zanpakutō, but she is revealed to have one in an illustration in the artbook &quot;All Colour but the Black.&quot; Her zanpakutō takes the form of what appears to be a thin katana.",

He is Yylfordt Granz&#039;s younger brother, although Szayel is much stronger. The remains of his hollow mask take the form of rectangular-framed glasses that give him a scholarly appearance. His arrancar outfit is slightly different from others in that he wears a shorter hakama that exposes a type of sock covering his shins. His shirt is somewhat different from other arrancar as well, as most arrancar have some form of jacket instead. The sleeves are unnecessarily long, covering the majority of his hands, and it has extra seams on the chest area. In his later appearance he also dons a cape. Szayel is the scientist of the Espada, developing various spiritual equipment for use by the arrancar. Using various methods, one of which involves implanting a subject with rokureichū (a data-gathering device), he is able to analyze the spiritual power of an opponent through those that person has defeated. He is also adept at creating devices that can manipulate and suppress spiritual power, as evidenced in his battle with Renji Abarai. Much like Mayuri Kurotsuchi, he is quite sadistic and seems to view others as little more than research material.  \n\nSzayel is portrayed as a stereotypical intellectual. He is quite fastidious, often having a plan that he follows down to every detail and throws tantrums when they are disrupted. Szayel is also snobbish and condescending, openly or otherwise, to both allies and enemies, especially to entities who aren&#039;t hollows. This behavior also extends to his motive for his allegiance to Aizen, as he hopes Aizen will do away with the non-hollows once he becomes the king of Soul Society. Despite his attitude, Szayel is mockingly considerate enough to quiet his followers and remain quiet himself so his opponent can say something. \n\nSzayel sometimes acts without Aizen&#039;s approval, and while he is very polite to Aizen in person, gestures he makes when his back is turned suggest that he resents him. Like the rest of the Espada, he possesses numerous Fracci&oacute;n, though his are hollows he personally modified and had made into arrancar by Aizen. Two of his notable subordinates are Lumina and Verona, both of whom are round arrancar with bare feet and sparse hair, though Lumina was eaten to heal her master. Szayel seems to show the same lack of care for his creations as Mayuri, using them as fodder in battle. When Verona speaks up against this after Lumina is devoured, Szayel quiets her by saying he&#039;d just &quot;make a new one&quot; later.    \n\nSzayel first appears when Aizen gathers the Espada to inform them that Hueco Mundo has been invaded by Ichigo Kurosaki, Uryū Ishida, and Yasutora Sado, and, despite the order to stand by idly, Szayel orders out the Exequias, though Aizen doesn&#039;t punish him. He later faces Renji, Uryū, Pesche Guatiche and Dondochakka Bilstin, during which his resourcefulness and analyses of his opponents allow him to come out on top. Szayel finally meets his match with the equally cunning Mayuri Kurotsuchi. \n\n~!Kurotsuchi, having observed Szayel&#039;s abilities through organism implanted in Uryū&#039;s body, counters by replacing his organs with artificial ones, then gains the upper hand by releasing his bankai and having it consume the Espada. Szayel, however, is reborn through Nemu Kurotsuchi via another of his abilities, which allows him to implant himself into his enemies and reform even after death. But unknown to Szayel, Kurotcuchi had earlier created failsafes in the event his daughter&#039;s body was ever consumed or invaded. Among these was a drug that vastly augmented Szayel&#039;s reaction time and perceptions, to the point where one second seems like a century to him. With his physical body unable to compensate for his over-enhanced mental state, Szayel is effectively paralysed. Kurotsuchi then proceeds to stab him, informing him that, as a result of the drug, the agony of every injury will seem to drag on for a hundred years.!~",

Jinta also mentions that she reacts to strange spiritual presences, such as those of arrancar. During such times, Ururu seems to take on a rather simplistic view of right and wrong. She considers those that cause harm (relative to her) as enemies, and believes that enemies must be eliminated.    Ururu&#039;s meek attitude is somewhat at odds with her fighting ability, which is undefined, but quite high (Urahara vaguely mentions that her fighting ability is at an &quot;anti-shinigami&quot; level). Her leg-strength in particular is far greater than it should be, even when compared to Kon while he&#039;s in Ichigo&#039;s body. Her combat skills are shown when she gives the arrancar Ilfort Grantz a devastating kick to the head while he is fighting with Renji Abarai, overpowering him to the point that he is forced to release his zanpakutō. In the anime, she also delivers a powerful kick to Sawatari&#039;s giant whale doll, Baura.    (Source: Wikipedia)",

She uses honorifics when addressing everyone, including her subordinates, and rarely shows panic or distress. She is even polite when angry (for instance, when members of other divisions bully her division), maintaining her smiling demeanor while radiating a dangerous aura that immediately scares others away. She wears the standard shinigami captain uniform, but wears an obi instead of the normal one, and her hair is worn braided over her chest. Presumably the longest serving captain after Kyouraku and Ukitake, Unohana has a presence that tends make everyone around her feel at ease. However, her anger is just as potent as even members of 11th squad become paralyzed with fear whenever they're careless enough to invoke her wrath. In omake chapters and scenes, it is shown that Unohana has a curiosity about convenience stores in the world of the living, and also likes picking racy swimsuits for Isane when she visits the living world.    ~!Unohana is the original \"Kenpachi\" (a name given to the strongest shinigami). Although she now goes by Unohana Retsu, her name is actually Unohana Yachiru.  Unohana was the founder of 11th division and its first captain. Before joining the Gotei 13, she was the most diabolical criminal to ever exist in Soul Society.  At some point in time Unohana was taught healing techniques by Kirinji Tenjirou. !~",

In other respects, he is the stereotypical Japanese teenager: he enjoys watching fireworks, playing role-playing-games, going to beach parties, and so forth. Originally little more than a source of comic relief, Keigo becomes a more prominent character later in the series. The Asano family consists of Keigo's mother, father, his sister Mizuho, and Keigo himself. Like Tatsuki Arisawa, he is unusual in that he lives with both of his parents, unlike many other recurring characters in the series.  A good-natured teenager, Keigo is used mainly for comical effect, usually in situations involving failed attempts to woo girls and interacting with Ichigo. He is good friends with fellow student Mizuiro Kōjima, whose calm, innocent demeanor, and success with women acts as a foil to Keigo's impulsive, wannabe personality.  Keigo appears to be a shallow character at first glance, with a passion for slacking off. Indeed, he takes great pride in not making it to the honors roster (higher than the 50th ranking) and labels those who do so \"traitors\" (including Ichigo and Chad, who made the 23rd and 11th ranks respectively). However, Mizuiro states that Keigo is much smarter than his bad grades show.  Later, it is revealed that Keigo can see ghosts and even soul reapers, in the Hueco Mundo/Arrancar arc. The first soul reaper Keigo ever saw was Ikkaku Madarame, who saved him from an arrancar. Keigo also got to see Ichigo in soul reaper form, before Ichigo left for Hueco Mundo at Urahara's underground training site, with Tatsuki and Mizuiro.  (Source: Wikipedia)",

The remains of her hollow mask make up a cartoonish skull on the top of her head. Nel and her companions believe Soul Reapers, not hollows, to be evil, and as such are afraid of them. In spite of this, she develops an attachment to Ichigo Kurosaki and starts following him around after her introduction. She often mispronounces Ichigo's name as 'Itsygo' due to her lisping, and she is a self-proclaimed masochist.   ~!Nel's true form is that of a fully-grown woman, her mask appearing less cartoonish with a pair of curved horns. A large \"3\" tattooed on her back indicates that she was previously the Tercera Espada.   Tired of her superiority over him, Nnoitra Jiruga snuck up on and attacked Nel from behind with the help of Szayel Aporro in the past, managing to crack her mask, causing her to turn into her child-form, giving her amnesia, and allowing him to expel her from the Espada. When Nel runs into Nnoitra years later as he begins to torture Ichigo, she turns into her adult form with her memories restored. Though considerably more mature than her child form, she retains her child-like voice and affection for Ichigo, as she comically hugs him without realizing that her strength is causing him personal injury. As she is about to defeat Nnoitra, Nel reverts back to her child form, losing all of her adult powers.  In her child-state, Nel's vomit (which she believes to be saliva) acts as a rather weak, but useful, healing agent. In both her child and adult form, she can swallow cero attacks and fire them back. In her adult form, she can also add her own cero to this blast, doubling its power, aptly named a \"cero doble\". Nel's zanpakutō, which manifests when she transforms, is named Gamuza (羚騎士（ガミューサ）, Gamyūsa, Spanish for \"chamois,\" Japanese for \"antelope knight\"). Her released form is that of a ibex-like centaur with longer curved horns, a thick tail, and armor over her shoulders and hands. Her sword transforms into a double-ended white lance, giving her the appearance of a medieval knight or a jouster. One of her attacks in this form is called Lanzador Verde (Spanish for \"green lancer\"), in which she throws her lance directly at her opponent. The lance moves at high speed and rotates extremely fast, drilling through anything it hits.!~",

There are many scars on his torso and head, suggesting numerous battles in his past. He wears the standard Shinigami Captain uniform, but its size is greatly exaggerated. He also drapes his haori over his back instead of actually wearing it. Despite his old age, he has a very muscular body. As the general of Gotei 13, Yamamoto is highly respected by many Shinigami, most notably Komamura Sajin, who views Yamamoto as a benefactor who saved his life. He has a fiery temper, and like fellow Captains Byakuya Kuchiki and Soi Fon, he believes that laws must be executed for the benefit of the community and despises those who break the rules. General Yamamoto founded the Shinigami Academy about 2000 years before the main Bleach storyline. Yamamoto was himself a teacher at this academy, and personally instructed Kyouraku and Ukitake. He admits to being rather proud of Ukitake and Kyouraku. When they became Captains, he &quot;boasted about them as though they were his own sons.&quot; It has been revealed that he had ordered Urahara Kisuke to stabilize the Garganta gate so that Captains can pass through, and has sent 4 Captains so far to back up Ichigo&#039;s team.    Yamamoto&#039;s Zanpakutou is Ryuujin Jakka (Flowing Blade like Flame, Viz: Flowing Flame Blade). It is the oldest and most powerful fire-based Zanpakutou, and has greater attack power than all other Zanpakutou in the Soul Society. In sealed form, it is disguised as Yamamoto&#039;s staff, which disintegrates into a sword on command. Its Shikai command is &quot;reduce the whole of creation to smoldering ashes&quot;. When released, Ryuujin Jakka and the area around Yamamoto is consumed in flame. The sheer power of the flame can disintegrate almost anything the sword is waved at. Only powerful fighters such as Kyouraku and Ukitake can resist it. Even in its Shikai, Ryuujin Jakka&#039;s power is enough to fight against two other Captains&#039; Shikai simultaneously. His abilities as a Shinigami are no doubt powerful, as he was able to bring 8th Division Lieutenant Nanao Ise to her knees and immobilize her by looking at her and releasing his spiritual pressure. He was also able to fight on par with two of the most powerful Captains, Shunsui Kyouraku and Jūshirō Ukitake, for a decent period of time without any sign of injury, while they both came away with minor wounds.",

His chin is marked by several triangular tattoos. The remnants of his hollow mask consist of a small row of bony spikes extending along the crest of his head, skull-shaped earrings, and a bony necklace. Zommari's first major appearance is shortly after Aaroniero Arruruerie's death. As he is about to finish off Aaroniero's killer,Kuchiki Rukia, he is interrupted by Kuchiki Byakuya. The two do battle and, after releasing his zanpakutō, Zommari takes control of Rukia's body to use as his puppet against Byakuya. Byakuya counters this attempt and attacks Zommari with his bankai. Zommari barely survives, realizing that he has lost. He begs for his life before he angrily dismisses shinigami as arrogant for believing they have a right to hunt and judge hollows simply because they consider them evil. Byakuya counters by stating he was fighting simply because Zommari &quot;pointed [his] sword at [his] pride&quot; (referring to Rukia), then coldly kills the Espada with a single strike. Zommari dies shouting his praise for Aizen.    Zommari's son&iacute;do is the self-proclaimed fastest among the Espada, to the point that he can leave up to five afterimages of himself behind when he moves, which earned it the name Gemelos Son&iacute;do (双児響転（ヘメロスソニード）, Hemerosu Sonīdo?, Spanish for &quot;Twins Sound&quot;). His zanpakutō is called Brujer&iacute;a (呪眼僧伽（ブルヘリア）, Buruheria?, Spanish for &quot;witchcraft,&quot; Japanese for &quot;sangha of bewitching eyes&quot;) and resembles a regular katana except for the guard, which appears as a thick disk with spikes around the rim.

When released, Brujer&iacute;a covers his entire body with fifty open eyes, and his legs are replaced by a pumpkin-like structure surrounded by cycloptic faces. Using the eyes on his body, Zommari can take control of one object per eye. He refers to the effect as amor (Spanish for &quot;love&quot;). This is signified by a sun-shaped mark on the affected area and dilation of the activated eye. Although he can take control of an opponent's limbs individually, he can also take control of their entire body by targeting their head. The release can also be used as a defensive resource, as its lower half can become a full sphere that covers his upper body. This sphere was strong enough to barely withstand the attack of Byakuya Kuchiki's bankai, at the cost of depriving him the use of a substantial amount of eyes.    Source: Wikipedia",

      "description": "__Height:__ 342 cm\n\nGrand Fisher is a hollow that had evaded the shinigami for over 50 years and is responsible for the death of Ichigo's mother, Masaki Kurosaki. In the anime, he prefers to eat women, which is why he killed Ichigo's mother; in the manga, he prefers to eat children, and Ichigo's mother merely got in the way. In hollow form, he resembles a giant hamster with bird-like hands and feet and a tentacle-like limb that hangs from his forehead, similar to the esca (lure) of an angler fish. The lure is vaguely human-sized and can be transformed to resemble anyone Grand Fisher wishes, usually taking the appearance of one of his previous victims. It can act independently of Grand Fisher, and as long as either the lure or Grand Fisher himself survives, he cannot be purified. \n\n As a hollow, Grand Fisher's preferred method of fighting shinigami involves using his angler to keep opponents at bay, rather than attract them as it would normally be used. By transforming the angler into a decoy copy of someone close to his enemy, he can keep them from attacking, since they will be unwilling to harm the decoy. He can also grow his hair and fingers into spikes to stab enemies, or use them to restrain an opponent. Grand Fisher explains that when his hair and claws are used as spikes to stab an enemy, they also absorb the memories of that particular enemy, hence his ability to use the lure to create a copy of their loved ones or friends and use their image as a shield. Outside combat, his angler is used like its namesake, allowing him to distinguish those with high spiritual power from common humans and devour them. \n\n After his defeat by Ichigo, Grand Fisher is turned into an imperfect arrancar by Iceringer and used by Aizen as an experimental subject. In arrancar form, he resembles a larger, more humanoid version of his old self with a tattooed face poking out from between his jawbones. He carries a large zanpakutō on his back, which is almost as tall as a two-story building. By unsheathing it, he transforms into a huge, monstrous creature with bull-like horns, and his zanpakutō becomes the size of a skyscraper. He returns to the human world to kill Ichigo, but instead is killed by Ichigo's father, Isshin Kurosaki.",

His hollow hole is slightly lower than normal, positioned near his stomach instead of his chest. He and Dondo were once Nel Tu's Fracci&oacute;n, but had their masks forcibly removed by Nnoitra and were left for dead with Nel. After realizing that their master had reverted to a defenseless child, he and Dondo pledged to protect Nel by never telling her about her former life. He spent the following time traveling around Hueco Mundo with them. He accidentally accompanies Uryū into Las Noches, having mistaken him for Ichigo. This initially upsets Pesche as he believes Uryū to be the weakest member of the group due to his appearance, while thinking that Chad is the strongest.    Pesche possesses an ability he calls &quot;Infinite Slick&quot; (無限の滑走（インフィナイト・スリック）, Infinaito Surikku?),[2] in which he sprays his saliva at an object, severely reducing its friction. Though seemingly useless, he is able to render Cirucci's weapon ineffective by coating it in his liquid, and it can be used similarly to make opponents lose their footing or grip on things. The liquid is limited in supply, contrary to its name. Pesche states that he named it as such because &quot;Finite Slick&quot; didn't sound nearly as cool. He can also perform a synchronized cero attack with Dondo. In addition to his powers, he carries an energy sword he calls Ultima (究極（ウルティマ）, Urutima?, Spanish for &quot;final,&quot; Japanese for &quot;ultimate&quot;) which he compares to one of Uryū's Seele Schneiders, humorously drawing it from his loincloth using its vaguely phallic hilt.

Her outfit consists of a frilly dress, large poofy sleeves that cut off at her shoulder, short purple-colored hair, teardrop markings on each cheek, and knee-high boots. Cirucci has wings on her back, but it is unclear if they are part of her outfit or something else. The remains of her hollow mask are positioned in her hair right above the left side of her forehead and resemble a spiked hairpin. Despite her rather odd appearance, she has no qualms about pointing out when others have similar habits, as she does to Uryū Ishida. She also gets quite bothered if an enemy attacks her while she is talking.    Cirucci's zanpakutō is named Golondrina (車輪鉄燕（ゴロンドリーナ）, Gorondorīna?, Spanish for &quot;swallow,&quot; Japanese for &quot;car-wheel iron swallow&quot;) and is released with the phrase &quot;rip off&quot; (掻っ切れ, kakkire?). In its unreleased state, it takes the form of a whip with a chakram looped into it that is capable of deflecting incoming projectiles in addition to its function as a standard whip. When she releases it, Cirucci sprouts large wings with ten moon-shaped blades in place of feathers. In addition to their normal offensive and defensive properties, Cirucci can remove these blades and fire them through the air or summon them back at her own will. Her wings and feathers vibrate at high speeds that increase her attack and defense capabilities. Her arms also become long and she gains sharp claws on each hand, and she forms a long, thick tail. Armor that resembles the spinning disk of her zanpakutō appears on each of her shoulders. Her mask grows into 'feathers' flowing from her forehead, down her back, and then coming out from each side at her waist. Cirucci's release consumes her spiritual powers rapidly, but she can get around that problem by ripping off her wings and long claws, instead using the tip of her elongated mask to collect spiritual energy and use it to fight with an energy blade at the tip of her tail. This change is permanent, akin to amputating limbs.",

Tesla also wears a different style jacket from most arrancar in that it resembles a lab coat. The remains of his hollow mask appear to be a thin upper jaw which forms a circlet around his forehead. Although he was a Numero his power was comparable to that of a captain as he was able to block Chad&#039;s Diablo attack (although Chad was in a weak condition) with his sword, and was able to seriously injure Ichigo while in a weakened bankai state.     Tesla seems to idolize Nnoitra to a degree, his eyepatch (though not identical) echoing that of his master. This is also shown when he stands by his act of shielding Nnoitra against Chad&#039;s last assault, despite criticism from Nnoitra himself. Nnoitra first instructs Tesla to restrain Orihime while the Espada fights Ichigo, and later to finish off Ichigo. He mercilessly beats the weakened Ichigo in his released state until he is stopped and is badly wounded by Kenpachi Zaraki. He is later seen on the ground in his unreleased state, dropping a tear for the fallen Nnoitra.     Tesla&#039;s zanpakutō is Verruga (牙鎧士（ベルーガ）, Berūga?, Spanish for &quot;wart,&quot; Japanese for &quot;tusked armored warrior&quot;). He releases it with the phrase &quot;crush&quot; (打ち伏せろ, uchifusero?) When sealed, it takes the form of a rapier with a chakram embedded in the blade just above the hilt. Tesla can make the ring solid if he wishes, as seen when he blocks an attack from Chad using the solid ring then converts it back to a hollow one after Chad has fallen. The guard seems to be made of a kind of scaled ribbing. When released, Tesla becomes a large, warthog-like creature. His mask grows to cover his entire face, and also produces a pair of tusks. His hair also grows into a mane. In his released form, Tesla&#039;s mask has a large scar covering his right eye, where he has an eyepatch on his unreleased form.

In reality, just like his current boss, he is a Shinigami, who was once the Captain of the Kidō Corps. Like his good friend, Urahara, he was forced into exile, and currently hides in an untraceable gigai while helping out at Urahara Shop.    Tessai is a quiet, stern, level-headed man who often acts as a source of discipline to Jinta&#039;s childish behavior, though he has his own sentimental side. He is quite loyal to Urahara and takes meticulous care of the shop, actually bursting into joyful tears if anyone compliments his work. Conversely, when Soifon snubs it, his instant reaction is extreme irritation. He is known to buy TV-displayed medicines, which do not always work or have unpleasant side affects, much to Urahara&#039;s chagrin. He is also among the few who find Orihime&#039;s strange food ideas tasty, the other being Rangiku Matsumoto.    Tessai is a large, muscular dark-skinned man wearing square-shaped glasses and with an enormous handle-bar mustache. He is always seen in a white shirt with a blue apron, although during his time in soul society he wore an ornate dark robe over standard shinigami garb.    In the past, Tessai was once the leader of the Kidō Corps in Soul Society. The reason of his exile to the Human World is for using a forbidden spell even though it was for an unsuccessful attempt to capture Aizen. Currently he works as Urahara&#039;s personal assistant in both business and other duties. He has apparently held a position among the Shinigami for quite some time, at least 200 years, since he informed Rukia Kuchiki that the word &quot;Quincy&quot; &quot;brings back memories&quot; from that long ago.

      "description": "__Height:__ 180 cm (5'11\")\n__Number:__ 24  \n\nFindor Carias is an Arrancar in Sōsuke Aizen's army and one of Barragan's five Fracción. An alternate romanization of his name is Findore Klarius  He appears to be the most composed member of Barragan's fraccion. He is rather arrogant and confident in his abilities, as shown when he encounters Shūhei Hisagi and states that he will fight at exactly the same power level as a Lieutenant. He is also said to be very chatty and is called a \"chatterbox\" by Hisagi. Findor seems to be quite intelligent and calculating, being able to guess the average power levels of seated Shinigami officers and even replicate them while fighting. His analytical demeanor is also demonstrated by his habit of saying \"exacta\" (correct) very often. This stems from his belief that life is nothing but a sequence of difficult problems, and ones ability to make correct choices decides his fate. The remains of his hollow mask consist of a smooth helmet covering the upper half of his face, with eye holes, and a row of teeth sown across his chin like a strap. His hollow hole is not visible. Findor's arrancar outfit vaguely resembles a Spanish soldier and he has customized it with shoulder pads, knee-high boots, and a knife like protrusion on both his sleeves that extend along the top of his hands. Findor appears to be able to summon hollows by whistling as shown when he was ordered to destroy the four pillars that keep the real Karakura Town in Soul Society, though this is, most possibly, an ability shared, but not demonstrated by other high-ranking, Arrancar or even non-arrancar MenosAdjuchas.  \n\nHe first appears along with Barragan and the rest of his Fracción in the fake Karakura Town to do battle with the Gotei 13. Once Aizen, Ichimaru, and Tōsen are blocked off by Yamamoto's shikai, Barragan himself decides to give all orders. Findor is then ordered to summon four gigantic hollows to destroy the four pillars that keep the real Karakura Town in Soul Society. The hollows are killed however by Shūhei Hisagi, Izuru Kira, Yumichika Ayasegawa and Ikkaku Madarame, who are protecting the pillars. In response, Barragan sends each member of his Fracción to a different pillar stating that if they are going to guard them using ants he'll just have to send dragons to crush them. \n~!\nFindor is sent to do battle with Shūhei Hisagi. The two duel for a while before Hisagi comments that his power appears only at that of a fifth seat. Findor replies that he has passed this test and he will now fight at a lieutenant's level. Using the knife attached to his wrist he begins breaking off fragments of his mask increasing his power each time, finally breaking off half saying he is at lieutenant level.  After fighting for some time Findor finds that Shūhei isn't fighting at the level he believes to be lieutenant as Shūhei is the only one that is tired. Wanting to finish the battle, Findor releases his zanpakutō. After fighting for a while longer he forces Shūhei to release his own zanpakutō much to Findor's own surprise. He later removes 90% of his mask and told Shūhei that he's power is now Captain-level, but he was defeated by Shūhei instead. His current fate is unknown, but he's believed to be dead.!~\n\nCuriously, his hollow mask appears to act as some kind of inhibitor on his powers (similar to Kenpachi's eye-patch), and by breaking fragments of it off with the knife on his wrist, it can increase his power exponentially. When whole, his power level is equal to that of a fifth seat Shinigami, and when half of his mask he is broken he is as strong as a Lieutenant  Zanpakutō  Findor's zanpakutō is named Pinza Aguda (Pinsagūda; Spanish for \"sharp pincer,\" Japanese for \"crab sword cutting current\") and its release command is \"Engrave in the water surface\" (minamo ni kizame). Its sealed form resembles a Spanish épée or rapier. When released, it wraps around his right arm to form a giant crustacean claw. In this form, Findor can fire high-pressure streams of water from his claw that are powerful enough to easily cut through buildings.",

      "description": "Iba has a distinctive hair cut and wears black sunglasses with his standard Shinigami uniform. He collects sunglasses, his main source being &quot;Silver Dragonfly Glasses Store&quot;, the same shop where fellow lieutenant Renji Abarai purchases his goggles. He also smokes and carries his Zanpakutō as a small blade inside his uniform. He has a large tattoo on his back consisting of a cat on fire and the kanji shōfuku (inviting luck). These features, plus his informal style of speech, are all strongly reminiscent of a typical yakuza.    Iba is very loyal to his captain, though in the week after Kaname Tōsen&rsquo;s betrayal he spent a lot of time at the Eleventh Division headquarters in order to give his captain some space. Preceding their fight, Ikkaku mentions that Iba has become cockier since he left the Eleventh Division to become a lieutenant. Iba also seems to have recurring stomach problems, which he notes with shame on a few occasions. He and Ikkaku Madarame seem to have something of a working relationship, though it consists mainly of them dueling, drinking sake, then dueling again to see who has to get more.     Not much is known about Iba&rsquo;s Zanpakutō, strength, or general personality. Iba is seen frequently in the company of the other male lieutenants and seated shinigami. He seems to share their pension for perverted things related to the female Shinigami of the Gotei 13. He is also both extremely loyal and decisive, as seen when the Arrancar, Pō sent his captain flying right before unleashing his Zanpakutō, turning into a colossal creature. With his captain briefly sent out of the battlefield, Iba grabbed the injured Ikkaku (his former squad mate) and ran, knowing that even if Ikkaku was in primed shape and the two of them were to take on Pō&#039;s released state at the same time, they would never have a chance to survive against someone with immense power to briefly overwhelm a Shinigami captain. His loyalty to both his former and current squads became visible when he refused to abandon Ikkaku just as Pō was about to attack the two of them, ignoring the former&#039;s protests and reasoning that Iba has a better chance of surviving Pō&#039;s attack if Iba would just let him be; not soon after that when Komamura rise up again to counter the Arrancar&#039;s attack, and then telling Iba to not stray by his captain&#039;s side, to which Iba immediately complied.     Iba seems to enjoy fighting, like the other members of the 11th division, but unlike many of them, puts his loyalty to his division above his desire to fight, and is not above retreating from battle.     The macho-ist lieutenant presides himself as president of the Shinigami Men&#039;s Association and forces all members to dress like him at meetings, including wearing their uniforms and sunglasses in similar manners to his own. His meetings consistently have him as the butt of the jokes of the Shinigami Women&#039;s Association, consistently at odds with their vice-president Nanao Ise on their actions and manners.     Iba speaks in Hiroshima dialect, and wants to spread its knowledge more, therefore at some point in the past he started a course on his own expense, but had to close it down in lack of attendance. He currently pens an article in Seireitei Communication&#039;s &quot;Guys Corner&quot; titled &quot;The Hiroshima Dialect Seminar Brimming with Macho-ism.&quot; His favorite food is okonomiyaki, but only if it is done in Hiroshima style, while he detests the one prepared in Osaka style.     Iba was originally from the 11th Division, but transferred to the 7th Division because getting promoted to lieutenant in the 11th Division was more difficult, if not impossible. It is later suggested that he wished to become a lieutenant not out of personal ambition, but to please his mother. As a result, his former compatriots in the 11th Division look down upon him, as they deem the other divisions weaker than they are. In spite of this, he has a habit of hanging around their division&#039;s headquarters. Despite having left the 11th Division, it is clear he still enjoys a good fight, and during his duels with Ikkaku reveals a maniac grin much like his sparring partner.     Though Iba has been seen infrequently throughout the series, we do know that he will try to do the right thing. He tells a dumb lie to his captain directly before Rukia&rsquo;s execution because he knows Komamura is unsure of the decision, and wants to give him time to decide. Komamura sees right through this, but lets it go, understanding it as an act of compassion.     Soon after that Komamura and Tosen take their vice captains, Iba and Shūhei Hisagi, to challenge Kenpachi Zaraki because he has freed Ishida, Chad, and Ganju from their cell with Orihime&#039;s direction and is leading them to Sōkyoku to stop the execution. Yachiru takes control and starts to lead the group ahead to Sōkyoku when the four Shinigami confront them. After Kenpachi claims he can take on all four, Yumichika Ayasegawa and Ikkaku Madarame complain that they want some action, and so Kenpachi lets them have Shūhei and Iba. We see little of Ikkaku and Iba&#039;s fight. Most of the scene we see is the two of them sharing a bottle of sake. While they are resting from their fight, Ikkaku unwittingly reveals that Iba mastered all elements of Shinigami combat in order to become vice captain. When Ikkaku mentions that he sounds unhappy, Iba denies it. When Ikkaku goes on to say that Iba has become vice captain for his mother, Iba denies it again. Iba abruptly changes the subject by pointing out that they&rsquo;ve run out of sake. After that they play rock-paper-scissors to see who gets the higher ground. Iba wins the rock-paper-scissors match, and before they begin both of them wonder who Byakuya Kuchiki is fighting on Sōkyoku Hill. Ikkaku states that it is Ichigo. Iba admits that he&rsquo;d like to fight Ichigo, and Ikkaku tells him he has the spirit of the Eleventh Division. They decide that the loser of the match gets more sake while the winner rests, but remind each other that if either lets up, the other will die. However, the match is interrupted by Isane&rsquo;s report on Aizen, Tōsen, and Ichimaru&rsquo;s betrayal.     Later, when Iba is at the Eleventh Division headquarters, he is hanging out with Yumichika, who notes, with some irritation, that it is awfully loud because of Ikkaku, Ichigo, and Kenpachi. Iba says it has been like that since Ichigo started hanging out with the Eleventh, but it is better than quiet. Yumichika asks why he is hanging out there, and Iba says that Komamura wants to be alone.     He is seen hanging out with Marechiyo Ōmaeda in Rukongai, but is attacked by Jin Kariya and quickly defeated.     When Aizen along with his top three Espada and their Fracci&oacute;n attack fake Karakura Town, he along with his captain are amongst the Shinigami seen defending it. He asks his captain if they should take down Aizen or the Espada first. Sajin replied that they should take out the Espada first.     When Pō defeats Ikkaku Madarame Iba&#039;s captain Sajin Komamura saves Ikkaku. Komamura calls Iba, and Iba throws some rod items to stop Fake Karakura returning to normal. Iba realises that Pō is almost twice the size of his Captain, but when Pō releases, Iba is shocked. Komamura tells him to stay behind him as he releases his Bankai and defeats the Fraccion. After the fight, Iba reveals that he knows about Ikkaku&#039;s Bankai, and admonishes him for allowing the pillar to be destroyed because of his selfish desire not to reveal his true strength, and believing that because he is replaceable, it does not matter if he dies. Iba then tells Ikkaku that if he wants to do things his way, he must become stronger and win, even at the cost of his life.     After the fight begins between Hisagi and Allon, Iba momentarily steps in to attack, but is blasted away by Allon&#039;s Cero.   Iba is well-rounded in both swordsmanship and Kidō, only because it made becoming a lieutenant easier.     Expert Swordmanship Specialist: Being a former member of the 11th Division, which specializes in combat, Tetsuzaemon is a highly competent swordsman. He is also known to spar with Ikkaku Madarame, another expert swordsman, regularly.     Kidō User: Because he was working to become a Lieutenant, Tetsuzaemon also became skilled in Kidō.     The name and abilities of Iba&#039;s Zanpakutō are unknown, as well as its Shikai command. When sealed, it looks like a tantō, and he usually keeps it inside his Shinigami uniform with the hilt sticking out.     Shikai: In its Shikai, Iba&#039;s Zanpakutō extends into a falchion or a large bladed scimitar with a pick-like protrusion a short distance below the tip of the sword. The first times he releases in anime series, it is during his fight with Ikkaku and when he attempts to stop Jin Kariya, but the actual releases occur off-screen. He also releases it in the Bleach movie Memories of Nobody in a duel with Ikkaku. In the manga, he hasn&#039;t released it until the Fake Karakura Town Arc, when he attacks Allon from behind, but the command and name is still unknown.

He wears a light undergarment under his Shinigami uniform, as well as a pair of sunglasses. From the opening credits, it would seem that he has superhuman strength. Like Kenryuu, he is a servant of Rurichiyo Kasumiouji. He takes the responsibility of punishing anyone he believes to be being rude to their princess. It was possible that he is mute, because he has never been shown to speak, even when asking Kenryuu about Rurichiyo's location (he uses comical gestures to ask, which Kenryuu is able to understand) or releasing his zanpakutou. However, with Amagai's attack on Yamamoto, he is heard to have a highly squeaky voice so it is clear from his blush that he is self-conscious about his voice.",

He preached an unusual variant of Quincy philosophy advocating cooperation with the Shinigami. Sōken tried to make amends with the Shinigami by advocating a new system of response to hollow attacks: Quincy would be the first-response squad, protecting humans from hollows until the Shinigami arrived to dispatch the hollow, thus maintaining the spiritual balance between the worlds that was being destroyed by the Quincy.     However, his proposal was never accepted, despite several attempts. He was eventually killed in a hollow attack, as the Shinigami arrived to late to save his life. During the rescue of Rukia Kuchiki, Mayuri Kurotsuchi reveals to Uryū that this was his doing; he delayed the Shinigami meant to protect Sōken so that he could study Sōken's soul for his research.     According to a reflection of a photograph seen in Uryu's glasses, all that was left of him in the end was his head. His death is the primary reason Uryū hates the Shinigami, although after learning of the conspiracy Uryū's hatred has become less for Shinigami in general than for Mayuri in particular, despite the fact that the Captain saved his life during the assault on Hueco Mundo. Soken was also seen during the anime only bount arc as a vision to Uryu, where he told Uryu to rest. (Bleach WIKI)",

The Grand Fisher used the forms of humans whom he had devoured (mostly women) to attract other humans with high spiritual energy, and Ichigo, who at the time could not distinguish between ghosts and humans, saw Grand Fisher's lure and ran after it. Masaki, realizing this went after Ichigo and protected him from the Grand Fisher at the cost of her own life. According to Ichigo, Masaki was the center of the family and everything that went on with the family revolved around her. Due to this fact, Ichigo's family was greatly devastated by her loss.  They visit her grave every year, and that is the only day in the year Isshin smokes. The reason he smokes in front of her grave was because when they had first started dating, Masaki complimented him about how cool he looked while smoking. He also added that was the first and last time she complimented him about his appearance. Isshin hung up a large poster of her in his home, displaying the phrase \"Mazaki forever\".  According to Tatsuki Arisawa, Ichigo stopped crying every time he saw his mother. She claimed Ichigo had the most beautiful mother ever, and took it upon himself for her death. Isshin also thought it was his fault his wife died. He says this the reason being he couldn't get there in time to protect her from the Grand Fisher. When Ichigo asked him why nobody ever blamed him for his mother's death, Isshin explained to him that \"he was the man the woman I fell in love with gave her life to save.\" He also added that when they meet each other again, if he had ever blamed Ichigo, Masaki wouldn't be able to forgive him.    ~!She is a quincy and was adopted into the Ishida family.!~",

      "description": "Shrieker (シュリーカー, Shurīkā) is a Hollow with features resembling a frog and retractable bat wings on his arms. He is the fourth Hollow to be defeated by Ichigo Kurosaki, and the second to reveal his history.  Shrieker is a Hollow with high intelligence. Like many other Hollows, he is driven to kill; however, he also reveals that he was a murderer before he died. He is extremely manipulative, as he tells Yuuichi Shibata that he would revive his mother if he can run away from him for 3 months, just for the pleasure of killing anyone who gets involved with him. He also uses underhanded tactics in battle, as he threatens to blow up Yuuichi's cage to prevent Chad from giving chase while he hunts down Rukia.   ~!About 4 or 5 years ago before the main storyline, Shrieker was once a serial killer, that killed 7 or 8 people. He roamed around various places killing people using what looked like a butcher knife. Yuuichi Shibata's mother was his last victim. He stabbed her multiple times while she protected her son, eventually following her out to the veranda. As he was about to stab her for the last time Yuuichi grabbed onto his shoelaces, causing him lose his balance and subsequently fall out of a high story window.  This event led to Shrieker's death as a Human, but also his inevitable transformation into a Hollow, still holding a grudge against Yuuichi for killing him. Shrieker decided to play a game with Yuuichi, taking his soul out of his body, and placing it inside a parakeet. He told the boy that if he could run away from the Hollow in his current form for 3 months, he would restore his mother to life. Shrieker only started the game to gain more victims as no Hollow or other creature can restore life to someone who has died.  Attempting to save the boy's soul, two Shinigami were already eaten by Shrieker.!~ (Source: Bleach Wikia)",

During his early years, Chad was extremely violent; exploiting his advantage in size, he intimidated and hit any other children who annoyed him. Oscar Joaqu&iacute;n tried to teach Chad to be gentle, but was initially unsuccessful. One day, the fathers of the children Chad fought, seeking to punish him, attacked Chad. Oscar Joaqu&iacute;n stepped in between them, taking Chad&#039;s punishment without retaliation. Chad was inspired by this example to become a decent person. Afterwards, Oscar Joaqu&iacute;n gave Chad a Mexican coin. The coin was minted sometime between 1823 and 1909, and has the words &quot;Republica Mexicana&quot; (Mexican Republic) engraved on it, as well as the Mexican National Emblem. The monetary reform of 1905 minted Mexican coins with the words, &quot;Estados Unidos Mexicanos&rsquo;,&quot; are seen on the Mexican peso today.    Years later, when Oscar Joaqu&iacute;n had died, Chad made a vow that he would never fight unless it was to protect others, as instructed, even if his own life was in danger. The coin would come to symbolize this vow, which Chad now claims to hold more value than his own life.    When Abuelo died, Chad decided to return to Japan.",

Because he is primarily focused on attacking, he is vulnerable to counter-attacks and has been injured several times. The stronger Orihime&#039;s anger and killing intent, the more powerful he becomes. However, Orihime&#039;s timid nature limits his overall power and has contributed to his injuries in the past. At one point, Tsubaki was killed by the Espada Yammy Riyalgo, who crushed Tsubaki into tiny pieces. Orihime was distraught by this, and since the pieces were too small to find, she couldn&#039;t bring Tsubaki back. But due to meeting Hachi, who said Orihime&#039;s powers were similar to his, Tsubaki is restored by Hachi despite having no pieces of him",

He bears a strong resemblance to Jūshirō Ukitake, but with hair that is a dark red. His bangs curve more to the side while Ukitake's bangs are only slightly curved to the side. Eishima's bangs however, do not hang over his right eye like Ukitake's. He dresses like the other former members of the 9th Division, with the standard Shinigami uniform and a white jacket that he wears over his Shinigami uniform with a collar that reaches up to his neck.   __Personality: __  Unlike the more cheerful Captain Ukitake, Eishima appears to be a more calm, quiet, and serious person. Along with the other members of the group, Eishima tries to keep his captain's anger under control by restraining him when his lieutenant irritated Muguruma Kensei. He did not seem to be as annoyed by the 9th Division's lieutenant's antics, unlike his former captain.   __History: __ Turn Back the Pendulum arc:   ~!Eishima was first introduced when Muguruma Kensei and other high ranking seated officers of the 9th Division were sent to investigate the disappearance of the Rukongai residents. He and the other 9th Division members were seen saving a young Hisagi Shuuhei and his friends from a Hollow. When Kensei told Hisagi to smile, Eishima told his captain that it was too much to expect from him. After the battle, they learned from Kuna Mashiro (who was absent during the fight) that there were missing Shinigami as well after she discovered 10 empty shihakushō near the Hollow attack site. Kensei connected the number of empty shihakushō that Kuna found with the number of members in a vanguard that was sent to investigate earlier. Realizing the seriousness of the situation, Kensei gave various orders to his men. Eishima was ordered to contact Central 46 to alert them of the first Shinigami victims in the case. Later in the night, Todō returned back from the 12th Division as Eishima and Tōsen Kaname stood guard outside. Todō offered to take over guard duty watch from Tōsen so that he could have a break, but Tōsen refused, insisting that all three of them stood guard. Eishima told Todō that they were alternating guard duty in short periods as Kasaki Heizō and Kensei were inside resting and instructed Todō to keep watch at another spot. While Lieutenant Kuna, Kensei and 3rd Seat Kasaki were resting, they heard Eishima's voice as he was attacked. Kensei and Kasaki rushed outside to find a bloody Eishima and Tōsen lying on the ground.!~   __Powers &amp; Abilities: __  Swordsmanship Specialist: As a 4th seat officer of the Gotei 13, he possesses skills in the use of swords during combat and knowledge of swordsmanship.

She has a strong personality and expresses her thoughts by yelling. She also tries to drag Ryunosuke out of his shell and keeps telling him he shouldn't be so soft. She is quite sensitive when someone makes a remark about her flat chest and punches the culprit as punishment.   __Plot:__  _The Thousand-Year Blood War arc_  On the day they are scheduled to begin guarding Karakura Town, Shino spots Ryunosuke and greets him. Ryunosuke is very sleepy and looks the wrong way, so Shino slaps Ryunosuke. She tells him to get ready to leave to the Human World, but Ryunosuke admits that he is scared. Shino says that he has no reason to be scared, as he is with her, but Ryunosuke is not convinced. She then yells at him, telling him not be a sissy and to have faith in his abilities. She says that he should stick out his chest more, prompting Ryunosuke to jokingly remark that Shino has no chest to stick out. Shino punches him in the face as a result.  The pair arrive in Karakura Town alongside Kurumadani, who leaves them after offering them some encouragement. She tells Ryunosuke to split up: she will go north, while Ryunosuke goes south. While on patrol, Shino is hit by a group of Hollows and is found in their grasp by Ryunosuke. They were rescued by Kurosaki Ichigo and Shino recovered quickly, but had to wait for Ryunosuke, who took two days to wake up. When he finally did, she seemed relieved, but punished him for taking so long immediately after. When Ivan Azgiaro appears in the room, the pair watch as Ichigo kicks him out of a window, leaving them wondering who Ivan was.  (Source: Bleach Wikia)",

      "description": "Ashisogi Jizō (疋殺地蔵; Leg-Cutting Jizō) is Mayuri's Zanpakutō. Ksitigarbha is a bodhisattva that watches over children and the underworld. In Japan, where he is known as Jizō, he looks rather like a baby dressed as a Buddhist monk. In Zanpakutō form, Ashisogi Jizō has what looks like a giant baby's head on it. Its hilt is wrapped in cloth, and has several spiky protrusions sticking out right below the blade, which appear to resemble leaves.    __Shikai__  ~! __Ashisogi Jizō's Shikai command is \"Rip\" (掻き毟れ, kakimushire)__. In its Shikai, Ashisogi Jizō transforms into a deformed trident with curved, serpentine blades and a guard shaped like a baby's head (as Ksitigarbha is depicted), all mounted on Mayuri's sword's normal hilt.    __Shikai Special Ability:__ The baby's mouth secretes a poisonous vapor in this form. The weapon works like the venom of a spider bite; when an opponent is stabbed by Ashisogi Jizō, it severs the brain signals controlling the neural impulses for movement in the limb's of the victim, regardless of where they were struck. Unlike regular paralysis, the pain receptors and nerve endings are unaffected by the weapon, so the victim can still feel pain, even in a paralyzed limb. During the Bount arc, it is shown that healing the stab wound does not immediately remove the inflicted paralysis. !~   __Bankai__   ~! __Konjiki Ashisogi Jizō (金色疋殺地蔵; Golden Leg-Cutting Jizō):__ returns Mayuri's Zanpakutō to its sealed state and produces a giant caterpillar in a red cape with a grotesque baby's head and a silver halo.    __Bankai Special Ability:__ The creature breathes a poisonous derivative of Mayuri's blood which is lethal to anyone who breathes it, aside from Mayuri and Nemu. Numerous blades can also extend from its chest, allowing it to run through and skewer opponents. Only Mayuri has a cure for its poison, though Nemu usually carries it around. Mayuri can change the composition of the poison, as well, ensuring that no foolproof antidote can ever be manufactured to cure it, and no immunity developed against it. Mayuri has physically modified Konjiki Ashisogi Jizō itself so that it will self-destruct and return to its sealed state if it were to attack him, implying that it is sentient as well as organic, reminiscent of Captain Retsu Unohana's Minazuki.   Ashisogi Jizō also has the ability to transform Mayuri into a liquid when he stabs himself with its blade. Doing so doesn't kill him, but instead simply leaves him unable to attack or be attacked, making it an effective escape tool. He reforms after a few days. It's uncertain whether this ability is entirely the product of Ashisogi Jizō, since he specifically relates the ability to himself, not opponents. Mayuri's various physical modifications may have something to do with the effect. !~",

Äs also wears a dark mask that obscures the lower half of its face and features five spikes running down its center.   __Plot__  _The Thousand-Year Blood War arc_ Upon receiving the orders of the Vandenreich Leader, Äs and the other Stern Ritter gather at the Gate of the Sun, before traveling to Seireitei in order to participate in the conquest of Soul Society.  Once there, Äs and the other Stern Ritter create pillars of blue flame prior to engaging the Shinigami in battle. Indiscriminately massacring numerous lower-ranking Shinigami, who are unable to injure it, Äs is soon intercepted by lieutenant Renji Abarai. Äs proceeds to effortlessly block Renji's strikes with its bare hands, until they are interrupted in turn by the arrival of another Stern Ritter and Captain Byakuya Kuchiki. When its hand is later severely cut by Byakuya, Äs is berated by its ally for allowing its Blut to be broken so easily. However, with Äs' comrade soon disabled, Byakuya unleashes his Bankai, Senbonzakura Kageyoshi, only for it to be stolen by Äs' unnamed device.   __Powers &amp; Abilities__  _Fear Manipulation:_ Despite their considerable attack strength, the true power of these \"arrows\" lies not in their offensive capability, but instead in their ability to induce limitless fear in those who are struck. Just a single wound is enough to inspire a deep-seated fear towards Äs, causing victims to doubt everything and lose control of all rational thought. While this would typically result in instantaneous death, a person's heart being unable to bear such intense shock, an individual's experience and willpower can be used to resist this fear to an extent, although Äs is confident that all would succumb to it eventually.

Giselle has an antagonistic relationship with Candice Catnipp; she claims Candice likes to have \"fun\" with her subordinates, and frequently mocks her power and temperament. However, she is willing to help Candice when requested.\n\nIn battle, Giselle is very cruel, using The Zombie to force several Shinigami to kill themselves while they retained awareness of their actions and begged her to stop; however, she claims to not be a sadist. She has no qualms with using her unique powers to turn the bodies of her fallen friends and comrades into weapons to fight with.Giselle frequently uses reverse psychology to trick opponents into attacking her and triggering her special ability.\n\n~!In extra pages detailing some of the Sternritter that were released with chapter 615 in Shonen Jump, Giselle is confirmed to be biologically male.!~",
