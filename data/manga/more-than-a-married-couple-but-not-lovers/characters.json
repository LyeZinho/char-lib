She hopes by training by acting as a perfect newlywed with Jirou, she can earn the two of them enough points to swap each other out for who they truly want to pursue.

Shiori is academically intelligent and regularly scores high marks on her exams, although she is known to struggle athletically. She is especially bad at talking to boys she doesn't know due to past experiences she had in middle school, but is known to be very caring towards those close to her regardless of gender, including Jirou and [Mei](https://anilist.co/character/286619/Mei-Hamano).

He is paired with Satsuki Kaneyama in their school's Marriage Practical.\n\nSadaharu is portrayed as being a mild mannered and eccentric otaku who enjoys reading manga, watching anime, and playing video games. Like Jirou, Sadaharu also has lousy luck with women, preferring the women to be \"2D\" instead of real so they can't end up hurting his feelings. However, it appears that he and his practice partner get along well which indicates that the practical has somewhat improved his social skills with women. Sadaharu is considered to be the series primary comic relief character, having a knack for making light of serious situations by comparing them to similar events found in many Japanese media and pointing out common tropes. He often showcases incredible creativity by imagining himself or others in fictional circumstances that almost appear to break the laws of reality, with his rampant imagination even causing him to the break the 4th wall on a few occasions. Despite his absurd antics, Sadaharu is ultimately a good, kindhearted person and will go out of his way to help and support those he cares for when he sees fit.",

Above all else, he possesses a calm and cool demeanor in the presence of others which is what has earned him the respect and admiration of his peers.

Fitting to the archetype, Mei does not usually wear clothes that are considered girly, preferring to wear t-shirts and pants as opposed to dresses. Despite being a star athlete, Mei has stated that she does not do well in academics, having to rely on Shiori to help tutor her. Mei's personality varies widely depending on who she is interacting with, tending to be more friendly and respectful towards girls. With boys, however, Mei often shows them her more brash, no-nonsense side. It's unclear Mei is lesbian or bisexual, but she at least has a strong preference for girls romantically. Mei is known to be a woman of action who prefers to be direct and to the point, having no qualms with being blunt with people and openly telling someone the truth no matter how much it may hurt.",

Even though he has a crush on Akari, Shū appears to be a womanizer who shows attraction to other women and tries to make himself more appealing to them.
