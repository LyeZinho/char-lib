But while trying to join the space program, he is thrown for a loop when an accident introduces him to Tsukasa, a mysterious girl with strange powers. Is she an alien, a moon goddess or something else? Since she insists on marrying him, Nasa has plenty of chances to find out!\n\n(Source: Viz Media)\n\nNotes: The 16th volume includes the 4 chapter prequel \"FLY ME TO THE MOON\".",
