When Xin first arrives at the village head's home, Piao befriends him and gives him the dream of becoming the greatest general ever. Not much else is known of Piao's family or past.\n\nPiao was much more level-headed than his best friend, but their swordsmanship skills were practically on par with each other. It seems Piao did not have the same ability as Xin because he admitted to Zheng Ying that he thought Xin was stronger than him. Unlike Xin, Piao also seems more domesticated because he was a much better cook and could also clean very well. He also has more self-evident ability as a leader than Xin when he later charges into the member and inspires all the Kings troops into thinking that he was the King and even after realizing the truth. They were still captivated by his charisma and can never forget him and his sacrifice. Therefore it can be said that his leadership ability is far higher than Xin.\n\nTo clarify, in the manga, the reason Xin's potential is higher is because of his 'gorilla' strength and that Xin has a 'special' 'ambition/anger' stat to his strength ability. This means Xin does even better under pressure and he 'entered' a tranquil fury of a sort, while Piao does about the same under pressure as he would under normal condition (which is good enough for normal people but not enough to be called exceptional like Xin).",

In the past, he was a bandit leader with the moniker Yi Huan the Beheader.\n\nHis personality is said to be extremely brutal as he has no qualms in killing surrendered soldiers and personally beheaded every person in any city or village he conquered. This is shown in how he sends Wei soldiers, who have been severely tortured, along with bags of eyeballs back to their camp to decrease morale and incite fear.\n\nHe always has an arrogant smirk on his face and talks in a crude manner at times. He shows no respect for his foes as he calls Feng Xuan \"an old fart\" and \"trash\" before killing him. He is exhibits a sense of humor and sarcasm as in the case when a fellow crew member asked him why he made an unskilled man named Ogiko as 1000-man commander of The Yi Huan army, he replied \"Gyahaha cause it's funny obviously.\"\n\nHe also has a cool demeanor and almost never displays any shock no matter how bad the situation is. Yi Huan also shows a very dark side as he toys with Xi Bai Gui by dangling the idea of escape from death if he begged for his life then stabbed him several times after he refused to grovel.\n\nHe does exhibits a sense of loyalty exclusive to Ao Meng by holding the rank of Vice General in his army and coming when summoned as demonstrated when Tang Zhang used Ao Meng's name, as he knew that Yi Huan would simply ignore an request for a conversation with him.",

He is very boastful to the point of even saying lies about his strength.\n\nHe also appears to be rather dense often having his lieutenant Jun Sou chiding him on his incompetence. An example of this is shown when he misinterprets Jun Sou's explanation about Shin going as far to assume Shin killed Ou Ki and Kyou. Another example of his simple-minded attitude is when he yelled his name and rank at the Hi Shin Unit in hopes of having a one on one duel with Shin at the risk of giving away his location to everyone (which was ultimately successful). \n\nGai Mou is also rather lecherous as seen when he is indulging himself with four girls (claiming to be making up for 14 years of being imprisoned) before clashing with the Hi Shin Unit. He is later seen with them again when he questions Ka Ryo Ten after having some action with his concubines.\n\nPhilosophically, he sees Ren Pa and Ou Ki's opinion of war as a struggle of dreams and sentiments as a delusion meant to disguise the slaughter for what it really is. Thus he concludes that war is just a practice where the strong slaughter the weak. With this, Ou Ki and Ren Pa never took his challenges to duel him seriously and would withdraw as he didn't have a reason to fight that was worthy enough for them to consider.\n\n(Source: Kingdom wiki)",

He is a part of the Seven Fire Dragons of Wei who are Great Generals who's abilities are on par of those of the Zhao Three Great Heavens and Qin Six Great Generals. However internal fights occured, and three generals including Shi Haku killed 3 of the other generals, while Go Kei stayed neutral. As a punishment, Shi Haku and the two other generals were in an underground prison for 14 years.\n\nShi Haku is said to be Wei's best spear wielder. His mastery with the spear is said to be so skilled that he is able to deal grievous blows to the point his enemies are incapable of noticing that they've been struck. It is also said that his skills didn't go rusty but rather he surpassed his form over the last decade despite being incarcerated for 14 years.\n\n(Source: Kingdom Wikia)",
