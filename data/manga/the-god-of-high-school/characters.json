Participant and Student\n__Relatives:__ [Jin Tae-Jin](https://anilist.co/character/181867/TaeJin-Jin) (adoptive grandfather)\n__Style:__ Renewal Taekwondo, Jin Mori Original\n\nJin Mori is introduced as a carefree and energetic student with an obsession for fighting. He loves eating and having fun. Mori can be seen as both confident and arrogant due to his identity later revealed. However, he still cares deeply about his friends and family, and will get serious when either of them are hurt or in danger.\n\nJin Mori was shown to be a dominant competitor in early stages of the G.O.H tournament. His fighting style in the anime is shown to resemble his adoptive grandfather's renewal taekwondo. He also has his own special technique which he names 'Jin Mori Original.' The first is called Blue Dragon Kick. His second is called Twin Dragon Blue Kick. His third and final technique is called Blue Dragon Tempest.",
