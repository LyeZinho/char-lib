At first glance, Luffy does not appear to be very intelligent, often seeing things in childish manner and can easily be amazed by the simplest things. However, because he views the world in a straightforward and simple manner, he is occasionally the only person who can see past the events and see what should be done.  \n\nLuffy seems to have an unstoppable appetite, a characteristic that is common to the Japanese archetype of the (at times simple-minded) young adventurer with a heart of gold; perhaps the hunger more so in Luffy's case due to having an elastic stomach. Luffy is also another one of the several characters given the middle initial \"D\".  \n\nAlthough Luffy is fairly lightheaded and a funny character, he has an unstoppable sense of determination, optimism and commitment and will do anything to stand up for his friends and comrades. Along with that, he has great courage to back it up as well as unbelievable strength. Ever since consuming the devil fruit he was shown to be not worried about his inability to swim, much like his brother. Much of these traits are common among D's. His only display of true fear is towards his grandfather, to the point that he does not fight back and is intimidated at the mere mention of him.  \n\nLuffy never kills any of the villains, no matter how cold-hearted they are; instead, he frequently sends the villain flying, knocking them out or until the point that they are almost near death, which results in some of the villains searching for revenge, such as Buggy the Clown and Alvida. Author Eiichiro Oda explains that it's not a question of morality so much as a matter of punishing the villains for their crimes - he feels that killing the villains lets them off too lightly, whereas he considers letting them live to see their dreams be ruined a far more fitting punishment.  \n\nLuffy has a dream, and to even have a chance at achieving this dream, he says that he must find the One Piece and become King of the Pirates. He knows that to achieve his goal, he will have to defeat many strong opponents, including the World Government and his childhood hero Shanks.",

This is achieved by using one katana in each hand, and another in his mouth. He is also seen fighting with only one or two swords. When in a serious fight he ties his normally, tied on the arm bandana, on his head. Though not a samurai, he appears to maintain a certain degree of bushido, and is frequently mistaken for one. Unlike Luffy and most of the other Straw Hat pirates, Zoro has been known to kill his opponents if he has to, though never in cold blood. \n\nZoro has a stern, serious and distanced personality, however he often reacts in a goofy and exaggerated comic style due to his gruff, impatient attitude. On the ship, he normally either trains with weights or sleeps. The only work he is seen doing regularly is hoisting the anchor using his great strength. He also likes sake, almost to the degree that Luffy likes meat, but like [Nami](https://anilist.co/character/723/Nami), he never gets drunk due to his inhumanly-high endurance and tolerance for alcohol. Another notable trait is his lack of orientation, as Zoro often gets lost, even in small, familiar spaces or when being led by someone. Despite this, he is often the first to sense an enemy or danger, and the first to react. He is often displayed being well aware of dangerous situations and people around him.  \n\nZoro often reminds others of the harsh facts, which often shocks some of the other crew members, although they usually decide he is right. Zoro has also stated that he is an atheist, and has never believed in anything except himself. He often comes across as arrogant and overconfident, but only because he knows he's a strong man with great fighting ability. Even so, Zoro knows that he still has a lot of untapped potential, and is constantly seen training and trying to improve his fighting skills. He adheres to a strict sword master's code of honor, and never falsely brags or lies about his abilities, sometimes outright admitting a weakness, even to an enemy. He also never tries to escape from a fight or use trickery to win, believing that doing so is cowardly and scorning anyone who uses such tactics. Zoro is very vigorous, strong-willed, and determined.",

He loves to tell tall tales to Chopper (who believes him blindly) or anyone who's listening. The other aspect of Usopp besides his lying is his cowardice; he is a very timid person, or so he thinks. In extremely stressful situations, Usopp has proven to be far more courageous than he believes himself to be. He shows great resolve when his friends are threatened or mocked by outsiders. Even though he is a complete coward in battle, he is a useful part to the Straw Hat Pirates. He is extremely handy and can fix almost anything. He sometimes sees a role model in [Zoro](https://anilist.co/character/62/Zoro-Roronoa) who never seems afraid but always proud. Usopp lacks a bit of self esteem and is often taken advantage of by Nami to make her weapons or repair and improve them - something he is very adept at, having constructed the ingenious weapon \"Clima Tact.\" \n\nUsopp will also stand up and fight for not only the well-being of people, but also for their ideals - and the ideals of a pirate, which he holds very high. In battle he normally tries to trick his enemy by telling tales or mischievous lies to deceive them. Despite his lack of physical strength compared to other members of the crew, Usopp seems to be just as resilient as his comrades and this ability to bear loads and loads of damage, is one of his best traits, in addition to his cunning and intelligence, which has saved the Straw Hats on many occasions. Usopp also has outstanding marksmanship abilities with his slingshot and is on his way to becoming one of the best snipers in the One Piece world, although his goal in life is to become a proud and strong pirate like his father [Yasopp](https://anilist.co/character/9562/Yasopp) of the Red Haired Pirate Crew.",

He has superb fighting skills that only make use of his legs, in an effort to minimize damage to his hands which would impair his cooking skills. Sanji uses an array of powerful and varied kicking moves when he fights. His cooking skills are world class, and he was mentored in both cooking and fighting by Chef \"Red Leg\" Zeff of the Baratie. He was born in the North Blue, but grew up in the East Blue. Sanji is trash-talking and serious, and usually gruff and impatient, especially around men. This is contrasted by his \"love-cook\" side, as he is very amorous around women. Sanji is completely devoted to any beautiful woman, usually losing all common sense and composure in front of them, then attempting to comically swoon them. He has sworn to never let insult or injury happen to any woman while he can still stand, even if that woman is trying to kill him. This is often problematic in his fighting as he can't attack female opponents, and would rather die than hurt them. All this is apparently the result of a \"strict upbringing\".\n\nHis goal in life is to find the All Blue, a legendary ocean, which contains all the fish in the world. As such, it would be paradise for any cook with as much love for his work as Sanji, who holds great respect for the tools, ingredients, and art of cooking. So great is his devotion to his calling, that Sanji will not let any person or creature starve, regardless of them being friend or foe.  Being the crew's chef, he looks out for the health of his crew mates. Sanji respects Luffy as a captain, but often gets angry at him for eating too much, showing disrespect for the aesthetics of cooking, and generally being daft and irresponsible. He is constantly in petty fights with Zoro (sometimes calling him Marimo) over each others' traits and they have developed a rivalry, but have managed to make a devastating team together. He is very protective of the female crew members and Nami likes to take advantage of him, exploiting his extreme servility. Sanji originally wanted to cook Chopper, but has come to respect him as a crew member and friend. He's also good friends with Usopp; they team up and interact often, and Sanji understands him quite well.",

She had a bounty of 79 million beri (One Piece currency) since she was eight years old, during an incident in which she supposedly destroyed six Buster Call ships through the use of the powers she gained by eating the Hana Hana no Mi (Flower Flower or Blooming Blooming Fruit). The fruit's power enables her to conjure up multiple replicas of her body parts (most often her arms) upon any surface she is able to see making her very powerful and dexterous as a result. Robin joined the Straw Hat Pirates after Luffy saved her life, or (how she states it) Luffy forced her to live when she wanted to die. To atone for his crime, Robin demands that Luffy allow her to join his crew, to which he complies leaving every other crew member except Sanji in shock. Although feared at first, she is quickly accepted and viewed as a comrade by the crew.  Robin is actually an archaeologist of talent and despises anyone who thoughtlessly damages any piece of history. The World Government fears her because she can decipher Poneglyphs (stones marked with glyphs from an ancient language), which contain details capable of reviving ancient weapons that have the power to destroy the world. In reality, Robin has stated that she does not care about ancient weapons and that her dream is to find the True History written on the Rio Poneglyph.  Robin is a mysterious and serious person who appears quiet and reclusive, and the wisest in the Straw Hat's Crew. She was thought by those around her to be cold and mean, but it was proven that she is actually a kind person who always thinks before she acts. She often only speaks when something interesting or important has happened. She loves to study history, and the comfort and freedom to study and read. She is also quick to point out gross or realistically morbid facts, often creeping out Nami or Usopp. Robin is the wisest and most sensible member of the crew. She has a vast knowledge of the seas and the world and usually keeps her head during surprising situations, allowing her to logically analyze the situation without losing her cool. This trait makes her different from the other Straw Hats, who often comically react melodramatically to unexpected happenings and hold irrational ideas and conclusions. Despite her attempts to keep herself distant, Robin has fallen for her new friends and has taken the role of the distant den mother.",

Chopper often acts like a child, but he is an upright friend and companion who will try anything to overcome a task given by his team. He also still has distrust in humankind because of events his youth, where he was treated as a brutal monster. He will often outright insult a human who compliments him while smiling, dancing, and being obviously pleased. He also shows a certain interest in books, but mostly medicine related ones. Chopper is more or less on a journey to define himself, seeing almost anybody on his crew as a role model. This, combined with his naiveness, often causes him to imitate the other Straw Hats' actions, no matter how obviously silly.

Franky usually acts tough and is quickly angered, but he is also very emotional when it comes to sad tales and often bursts into large tears, or on some occasions, plays a song. His most distinguishable personality trait is his flamboyant attitude. He frequently shouts the word 'SUPER' when he's in a positive mood, or adds it into his speech. He also has a signature pose which he uses very often.  Franky is quick to defend other people (eg. Franky Family, Nico Robin) and take action if his friends are harmed. He is also quick in making friends, allies, and comrades with even the most unlikely of individuals. Because of this, he is seen as a 'big brother' figure. Monkey D.

He is also extremely flatulent after meals, but says \"excuse me\" so as to be \"gentlemanly.\" He also loves to tell odd, bone-themed jokes, as well as melodramatic tales, and is very perverted, asking to see Nami and Robin's underwear upon meeting them.   He's a skilled musician (something Luffy has always wanted in his crew since the beginning), fond of playing the violin. Due to his light weight he can not only jump to incredible heights but can run on water by moving his legs furiously. He uses a shikomizue as his main weapon; with it, he is able to make swift iaidō attacks that the enemy cannot notice.",

The abilities gained from this fruit also make Buggy immune to attacks from knives or swords; any such attack just separates him into his component parts.  In addition, most of his body is capable of flying through the air, fast enough to propel a man through a wall - with the crucial exception of his feet. However, even though the parts are separate, Buggy can still feel what the part feels (for example, when Luffy attacked Buggy, he separated his torso from his waist, only to find that Luffy was aiming for the crotch. Needless to say this left him with a rather painful result. Also when Buggy launched his hand out to pin down Zoro for Cabaji's Sting of the Unicycle Technique, Luffy stomped on it, inflicting tremendous pain). He also seems to require either a fixed distance from his detachments, or keep them within his line of vision, in order to manipulate them separately.  Besides his Devil fruit abilities he usually fights with three knives between his fingers. During the flashbacks of his youth he already used these three knives. He also has a blade hidden in his shoe and in Logue Town used a sword in his failed attempt to execute Luffy.",

Shanks and his crew are almost always seen partying and drinking alcoholic beverages whenever they make an appearance as the Captain's favourite pastimes are attending and hosting parties and banquets.

Goro Goro no Mi (Rumble-Rumble Fruit)!~\n__Type:__ ~!Logia!~\n\nEnel thinks of himself as an invincible god - quite literally. He believes that he is a divine and immortal being, with the authority to do, take or destroy whatever he pleases. As the result, he appears fearless, childish, and without a care in the world. His lifestyle is relaxed and hedonistic, and when not attending to his godly duties of smiting the natives of Skypiea, he spends his time sleeping or eating (Enel's favorite fruit is apples) in his residence, being waited on hand and foot by beautiful women. This attitude carries over to his battles, where he's hardly serious and barely annoyed - instead he's relaxed, and enjoys himself by effortlessly absorbing attacks, and humiliating his opponents. In his fight against Kamakiri, he even went to sleep in the middle of the fight, in order to prove his immortality.  Enel holds no regard for other's lives except his own, and has no moral qualms about killing thousands- instead he sees it as his godly duty, and laughs as he sends Skypiea to its doom. He is in short completely insane, which was more or less undeniable when he sets off for the moon, which he believes to be the home of God (himself). Before Luffy showed up, his fruit power and mantra ability made his God complex completely legitimate. Once Luffy began gaining the upper hand in the battle he incapacitated him, in order to remove him as a threat, and reclaim his status as \"invincible\" - and from this point acts somewhat cowardly, trying his best to avoid another confrontation with Luffy.  Enel appears to posses a vast knowledge of mechanics and technology as well. He personally designed his flying ark, Maxim, and knows its inner workings inside and out; if any damage is done to the inside, he is able to repair it (assuming it's repairable). He was even able to design a stormcloud production system (known as Deathpiea), an electrical power system, and a Jet Dial failsafe for the ark, in the event that the main engines are damaged. \n\nAfter Skypiea:\n\n~!After the Skypiea arc, Enel can be seen throughout chapter covers in an adventure called *\"Enel's Great Space Operations\"*. He sees the first lieutenant inside a crater after experiencing devastating defeat. After, the Fox-like space pirates attack once again, and seeing his \"Fairy Vearth\" blown up, he attacks the space pirates almost decimating their forces whilst also charging the generator used by the moonlings. Enel receives thanks and leaves to explore deeper into the crater. He encounters an ancient city and from his overwhelming strength come back. Finally he studies old murals and discovers his abundance of followers and land.!~",

Because of his status and power, defeating him is Roronoa Zoro's ultimate goal. Mihawk is so strong, in fact, he is accused by some characters (And fans) of having the power of a Devil Fruit; however, nothing has stated anything but that his abilities simply come from pure skill and power.  He wields the Black Sword (Grosses messer), the strongest sword in the world. It's an ornately decorated, man-sized (6 feet) sword shaped like a cross with a shiny black blade, curved at the end. It also seems to generate otherworldly purple streaks as it slices, as seen when he cut down Zoro and when he split Don Krieg's ship in half. He can tear pirate ships apart with a single, unseen slash of his sword, blocking bullets with a simple turn of his sword, and he can easily defend against even legendary swords with a small, inch-long knife concealed in the cross he wears around his neck.  In appearance, Mihawk wears very decorative, ornate, black-and-red clothing. His most identifiable clothing would be his wide-rimmed hat adorned with a large piece of fluff, a long, black cloak, and his cross necklace and sword. He is easily compared to the real-life pirate Bartholomew Roberts, AKA Black Bart, who also donned a crimson overcoat, a wide brimmed hat with a red feather, and a diamond cross attached to a gold chain around his neck. Mihawk travels around in a coffin-shaped raft with two green-flamed candles, a single black sail, and a single seat. The fact that he can traverse across the unforgiving oceans, as well as the Grand Line itself, in such a meager craft is yet another testament to his abilities.   \n\n~!After the events of the Levely, the Navy dismissed all of the Shichibukai, including Mihawk, and who is now a wanted pirate.!~",

Ace's back tattoo is left intact in the English version of the dub despite 4Kids' previous edits to crosses. At the same time Ace also promotes his tattoo to Luffy, something which is truly considered odd by 4Kids standards. Ace has a tattoo on his back of the Whitebeard symbol; a skull with a white mustache and a manji behind it. To avoid confusion between the two symbols and avoid slander for being a nazi, this was changed to crossbones in the shape of a \"cross\" in the anime, as well as in the most recent chapter of the manga.  Ace has another tattoo on his left arm by the shoulder: it reads \"ASCE\" with the \"S\" crossed out. ~!It serves as a symbol of his other deceased sworn brother Sabo.!~ In the English version of the anime, Ace's shoulder tattoo signifying his name is edited out, as he is referred to there as \"Portgaz D. Trace.\" He appears in One Piece Grand Adventure, once again without the tattoo on his arm.  Ace travels around the Grand Line on his boat which is constructed so his Mera Mera no Mi fuels the engine on the rear end allowing it to move.  Currently, Ace is one of the two known pirates to ever escape arrest by the Marine captain Smoker, the other escapee being Ace's younger brother Luffy. Ace and Smoker fought to a standstill in Alabasta.  He left Fuusha Village three years before Luffy, and he is a loyal crewman and commands the Second Division of Whitebeard, his captain.  In appearance, the two brothers are obviously related, despite the fact that Ace is more muscular than the rather lanky Luffy. He also sports rather childish freckles. He is apparently narcoleptic (a trait common amongst Ace's family) and therefore falls asleep on random occasions, making people wonder if he has dropped dead. As far as personality goes, Ace is much more intelligent, polite, and generally more bearable than his younger brother, which prompts the Straw Hat crew to question whether he is truly related to their bumbling captain. However, the brothers themselves are very close, Ace portraying typical good-big-brother behaviors such as asking the crew to keep an eye on his little brother.",

The other two great powers are the Marine Headquarters and the Shichibukai, the seven warlords of the sea.\n\nWhitebeard is said to be the strongest man in the world and the pirate closest to obtaining the legendary treasure, One Piece. It is said that Whitebeard used to have numerous battles with the late Pirate King, Gol D. Roger, and was marked as his equal in the past.\n\nWhitebeard appears to have some health problems, possibly stemming from his advanced age or from his ferocious encounters with other great pirates during his earlier days. He is always surrounded by nurses and is hooked up to intravenous tubes. But despite this, he still drinks rum by (and directly from) the barrel. Even with his health issues, he is still considered the world's strongest pirate, which raises the question of how powerful he must have been in his prime.\n\nHe was a cheerful and carefree person during his younger years, prior to commanding his own ship and becoming known as Whitebeard. Due to being an orphan who grew up in poverty, Newgate has a strong desire for a family. In adulthood, unlike his comrades who loved treasure and riches, he only desired a family and saw that as the greatest treasure.\n\nIn an attempt to rescue Portgas D. Ace from his execution, Whitebeard declared an all out war with the marine headquarters. Both Ace and Whitebeard died on the battlefield.!~",

Kuzan is a very laid back man, showing no shock or surprise from almost anything.

In contrast to his fellow admiral Sakazuki, Kuzan has a sense of honor. Kuzan's moral stance is unknown, but it is likely that he follows Moral Justice. He is disgusted by Sakazuki's brutal actions in dealing with situations, calling him a fool.

Ace. Shanks also warned Whitebeard that Blackbeard was becoming stronger than him and had only joined his crew to stay hidden behind the massive shadow of the Whitebeard name, until he became strong enough to make his move. This time came when Blackbeard murdered a member of the Whitebeard Pirates, thus prompting his departure from the crew, and Ace's hunt for him. Blackbeard was also the one who gave Shanks the scars around his eye, a long time ago. Shanks also tells Whitebeard to call back Ace on his hunt for Blackbeard, as he was concerned about the timing of a confrontation between Ace and Blackbeard.  After Luffy defeated Crocodile in Alabasta, Lafitte tried to nominate Blackbeard to become one of the Shichibukai to take Crocodile's place, but in order to be accepted, Blackbeard must first build up a fearsome reputation.  Blackbeard happened to be in Jaya, at the same time Luffy was. Both Luffy and Blackbeard seem to strike up a rivalry when they nearly got into a fight over how they like or dislike one of the island tavern's food. However, not long after that he'd given Luffy a friendly speech about how pirates will never stop dreaming. Despite their similarities (and comical contrasts), it was revealed in the Jaya arc that Blackbeard was looking to take out a strong pirate to make a name for himself - and he chose Luffy after learning of his 100 million Belli bounty at the time. He however failed to catch them as they were blasted aside by the knock-up stream which took the Straw Hats to Skypiea.    \n\n~!Blackbeard is currently one of the Shichibukai and has a former bounty of 0 Berri.

He seems to honor the samurai honor code very heavily as he comically attempts to take his own life after dishonoring himself. As he accepts the blame for nearly anything, even faults of others, this happens quite often in his appearances. Before he commits seppuku, however, he instinctively uses tekkai every time, unintentionally saving his own life.    He seems to have strong feelings for his deceased mother, beginning to sob, even while fighting, at the very thought of her. He claims her &quot;divine protection&quot; is the reason for his failed suicide-attempts. These dramatic statements are somewhat undercut by Oda&#039;s revelation that his mother is in fact alive, and working as an assassin. [3] He claims to dislike lies, though he seems to have no trouble with melodramatic stories. Kumadori is a sennin (仙人, a type of hermit in Japanese mythology who can control even their body&#039;s autonomic functions, as well as live forever, similar to fellow Shonen Jump character Jiraiya of the popular series Naruto), which explains his sudden weight gain/loss as well as the ability to control his hair.    Kumadori is a very loud character, and utters very few sentences not written in bolded fonts and ending with exclamation marks. He has the strange habit of yelling something resembling &quot;YOYOI!!&quot; rather often. He tends to repeat or draw out syllables and words in the manner of kabuki actors. Kumadori&#039;s name most likely comes from the Japanese word kumadori (隈取り, a type of makeup used for kabuki), as his features look very similar to those of kabuki actors in their makeup. His body positions (especially his penchant for holding one hand out in front of him) are also reminiscent of mie poses, and his vocal inflection is similar to that of kabuki actors. His fighting abilities seem to revolve around controlling his hair, using it to grab his enemies and attacking them. He also has a shakujō that he occasionally uses in battle. He also has a penchant for spouting off haiku when fighting.    Kumadori was originally fighting with Nami, who was at a severe disadvantage. However, Chopper appeared and helped Nami (after Nami had already stolen Kumadori&#039;s key) to escape, becoming Kumadori&#039;s opponent. Despite Kumadori&#039;s advantage of being a sennin, Chopper consumed a third Rumble Ball, and his subsequent &quot;Monster Point&quot; form severely injured Kumadori and threw him all the way back to the courthouse.",

Even with warnings about ships never returning from that ocean, he did not care; in fact, he even declared that was the reason for him going.  He was said to be completely fearless, and those who witnessed his execution even claim that he grinned just before his death. Many people who've met Monkey D.

Dragon is the father of Monkey D. Luffy and is also the son of Vice-Admiral Monkey D. Garp. Known as the Revolutionary Dragon, he is the world's most wanted criminal, and another one of the several characters given the middle initial \"D\". He has had his revolutionary ideas spread throughout the world and has taken several nations. He is also the only member of the D. family to look serious, partly due to his strange facial mark. Despite being an enemy to the World Government, he still keeps contact with his father.  Before the start of the series, Dragon left Luffy in Garp's care. Dragon first appears after a lightning bolt suddenly destroys the gallows where Luffy was to be executed by Buggy the Clown and then saves Luffy from being captured by Captain Smoker. When he saved Luffy from Smoker, a mighty gust of eerie wind swept through Loguetown. It is undetermined whether or not he was the cause behind the gust of wind or the lightning; however, the story leads to believe there is more to him than it seems. Recently, he has taken over an island in the South Blue and is about to head to the North Blue when he commented, after noticing Luffy's newest bounty, given to him after invading Enies Lobby, that father and son will meet sometime soon.!~\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

He is, however, fast and agile, and very skilled with a whip. He is also responsible for burning things, such as the pet-food shop and the Going Merry.  In his first appearance, Mohji was sent by Buggy to capture Roronoa Zoro. However, Monkey D. Luffy got in his way, who eventually defeated Mohji after he burned down a pet-food shop that belonged to a recently deceased man and his still-living dog.  After Buggy's defeat Mohji and Cabaji fought over leadership of the group. They were equally matched, and fought for several hours. The battle ended when a sleep-walking Richie knocked them both unconscious, taking over leadership himself. However, Richie and the pirates were kidnapped by a cannibalistic group, but saved by Buggy, Alvida, Mohji, and Cabaji.  Mohji later participated in the attack on Loguetown. It was his job to burn down the Straw-Hat's boat, which he failed to do as soon as it started to rain.[1] Nami and Usopp found him and Richie, but as soon as Mohji sent Richie to attack, Usopp used an egg to distract the lion. The Marines showed up, and started shooting at everyone. Mohji was able to dodge the bullets and flee the scene with the rest of Buggy's group.  Much later, Mohji reappeared with the group as they travel in the Grand Line and find a mysterious man named Portgas D. Ace. He was also in the TV Special that featured the One Piece characters as ninjas, and appeared in several video games. Every time Mohji appears in the series for an arc, his hairstyle changes. During the Buggy arc, his hair was shaped like a teddy bear; the Loguetown arc had him wearing a pink helmet with bunny ears sticking out; and when the group makes it into the Grand Line, his hair is shaped like a lion's mane.  \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

He fights with Roronoa Zoro no sooner than after being introduced and plays dirty by kicking Zoro's wounds whenever he has the chance. But once Cabaji is knocked off his unicycle, he is easily defeated by Zoro's 'Oni Giri' which cuts open his chest.  After Buggy's crew was defeated by Luffy, he fought with the 'other' first mate Mohji for the title for the next captain--both were knocked out by a sleepwalking Richie, who gained the title (though lost it just as quick). However, he returned to his former position when Buggy resurfaced.  During the Loguetown attack, Cabaji accompanied Buggy and Alvida to fight against the Straw Hats and Navy. However, despite wanting to have a rematch with Zoro, he didn't get a chance to do so.  \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

During this incident, he gained a back full of scars from the pirate crew&#039;s guns, vaguely scarred in the shape of the World Government&#039;s symbol. Shortly after that he became a CP9 member, and gained the reputation of being the group&#039;s most cold-hearted and efficient assassin in its entire history. As such, he is a very valuable asset to the World Government, almost to the point of legend; the other vice admirals believe that he can even survive a Buster Call attack.    At the Galley-La headquarters in Water 7, Lucci effortlessly defeated Luffy in a relatively short fight. Later in Enies Lobby, Luffy chased after Lucci and initiated a second fight with him. The two engaged in an extremely long, hectic and boisterous fight in which Luffy eventually emerged victorius. Lucci respectively bested, withstood and survived Luffy&#039;s attacks and various states until he was defeated. However, it took Luffy&#039;s last bits of energy to defeat him, as Luffy was in the floor and couldn&#039;t even move. This proves how much of a monster Lucci was, but also how much stronger Luffy has become.!~\n\n~!Lucci comes off as the most cold and collected member of CP9, almost never displaying any emotions. An example is the brutal assault on his friend of five years, Paulie, whom he even tried to kill after the CP9&#039;s identities have been revealed. He also states that he feels no real bond with the city he&#039;s lived in for those five years. He also seems to have no feelings for his fellow CP9 colleagues, least of all Spandam. His emotionless nature includes anger and distress (he&#039;s &quot;kept together&quot; all through his fight with Luffy, unlike all the previous villains). Even while taunting or demoralizing Luffy, he keeps a passive face, and refrains from the classic &quot;villain laugh&quot;. However, during the final moments of his fight with Luffy, he expresses surprise and anger prior to being defeated.  He seems to derive amusement and gratification from inflicting physical and emotional pain on others, making him a typical sadist. These scenes, along with when he anticipates battle, are the only times where he smirks. In Enies Lobby, he reveals that he works so he could be legally allowed to kill people. An example of Lucci&#039;s lust for violence is when he compromised the mission of bringing Robin to the Gates of Justice by allowing Luffy to tail him, for the sole purpose of having a battle. Lucci&#039;s violent and predatory nature is also shown when he goes into full-beast mode during battle, in order to attack Luffy more violently.  However, while Lucci does love the benefits of his job (killing people), he seems to be completely devoted to the government he serves as a tool from the shadows. He speaks of pirates as &quot;evil&quot;, and sees it as his duty to hunt down and eliminate Nico Robin. All this is revealed towards the end of his battle with Luffy, and is a sudden departure from his &quot;care for nothing but blood&quot; attitude. This may be because he was dominating the fight at the time, and his bloodlust, which otherwise overshadows his better judgement, had worn off since Luffy was no longer fun to fight. However, as his flashback in the anime shows, this moral isn&#039;t just limited to pirates. If Lucci sees anybody that he believes faulters in the face of justice, they have &quot;sinned&quot; in his eyes and must be eliminated. This is his own sense of justice which he calls &quot;dark justice&quot;. Lucci also appears to exhibit a rather high level of intelligence. It was he who deduced the connection between Iceburg and Franky, figured out the principles behind Luffy&#039;s Gear 2nd &quot;upgrade&quot;, and showed extensive knowledge about Devil Fruit. On Enies Lobby, he even effortlessly jeopardized the lives of Luffy&#039;s crewmembers and friends, as well as their mission to save Robin, by flooding the underwater passageway to the Gates of Justice. Although this might just as well be yet another display of sadism, where he removes Luffy&#039;s chances of &quot;having everything&quot; just for the sake of angering him. Lucci has a complete mastery of Rokushiki, having not only used at least one or more moves from each of the different forms with ease, but to such an extent that he can mix two or more forms together to great effect. He demonstrates this when he unveils the Rokushiki hidden technique, Rokuougan, during his fight with Luffy. The massively powerful technique, usable only by one who has literally mastered all six forms as stated by Lucci himself, is so strong that it causes severe internal injury to Luffy&#039;s body; no small feat considering he has a rubber body. Luffy described it as if an &#039;Impact Dial&#039; with much more greatly amplified power went off inside his chest. Not much is known about Hattori, the pigeon that is constantly seen perched on Lucci&#039;s shoulder. It appears to have no special significance. While acting as Lucci&#039;s voice Hattori expresses human body language, matching the behavior of a professional shipwright: constantly insulting and lecturing Paulie because of his reckless lifestyle. After the CP9 reveal their identities, Hattori loses many of his human characteristics, although he is seen wearing a coat and drinking from a cocktail glass.!~",

Like Mihawk and Donquixote Doflamingo, he was present at the government summit of Mariejoa following Sir Crocodile's defeat in Alabasta. Comparing his height to Perona's in Chapter 473, he is well over twenty feet tall and is only matched in size by Moria's true body. According to Gecko Moria, Kuma is the only obedient Shichibukai of the World Government.  Kuma seems to have the ability to teleport, which enables him to appear in the blink of an eye. Although the nature of Kuma's ability is unknown at this moment, he also shows the ability to make anyone he touches disappear to an unknown place, demonstrated when he makes Perona of the Thriller Bark crew disappear by touching her with his bare hand (she most likely went to the destination she said she wished to be). Also, Kuma asks Gecko Moria where he would like to travel to, further suggesting this ability. According to Perona, Kuma was known for his brutality as a pirate. However, his asking of where to \"teleport\" people reflects his change in personality. During a conformation of him and Gecko Moria, it was shown that the two are approximately equal in height, both being inhumanly tall. He also tends to use target metaphors (eg. \"We now have the same target\" and \"You're right on Target, I am Bartholomew Kuma\"). Due to his apparently reserved disposition and the fact that he is invariably seen with a large bible, Kuma is likely modeled after Bartholomew \"Black Bart\" Roberts, a gentleman pirate known for his religious obstinacy. Currently, Bartholomew has met with fellow member Gecko Moria about the appointment of Marshall D. Teach as a new Shichibukai member as well as to offer his assistance on the defeat of the Straw Hat crew. Though he has not met with them, he does have knowledge regarding Luffy's brother, Portgas D. Ace.   ~!Recently, after reporting Moria's defeat, he was ordered to eliminate everyone on Thriller Bark and chooses Roronoa Zoro as his first target. Following the events in Sabody Archepelago, he appeared in Pacifista form, having been fully turned into a robot by the World Government scientist Vegapunk. After encountering the Straw Hats, who were struggling after defeating one of the Pacifistas immediately after an encounter with Kizaru, he defeats them and transports each one to a different island.   He is once again present at the battle of Marineford, in Pacifista form, along with several mass-production models. !~",

However after falling asleep, Morgan makes his escape by striking Garp and taking Helmeppo as a hostage, fleeing on a small dingy. Garp then wakes up unharmed, apparently breaking a cannon in the process of waking up. When Koby begs to chase after the two, Garp allows Koby to persue them. Upon the boys return they offer themselves to be punished, but Garp instead proposes a different course of action. He states that the pair of them are nothing but trouble and the only way to ensure they still in line is that he takes charge of the pair. He takes them back to Marine HQ where he begins to train them to become great Marine Officers.",

In addition, he is also one of the top four commanders of the Whitebeard Pirates, making him one of the top four fighters on board under Whitebeard himself.    He is capable of retaining consciousness despite the powerful Haki of Shanks, a Yonkou. He has incredible reflexes, as he is able to instantly respond to Kizaru&#039;s light-speed movement and attacks to protect Whitebeard. He was also able to touch Kizaru, who is normally intangible due to his Logia ability. This may indicate that Marco is capable of using Haki.  Marco possesses super-human strength, as shown when he kicked Kizaru down to the ground at extreme speed, however it is unclear if it&#039;s natural or comes from the fact that he is a zoan-user.    Marco ate a Devil Fruit referred to as a Mythical Zoan that turns him into a Phoenix. This first and foremost gives Marco increased speed and flight, as well as the possibility of launching aerial attacks. Along with being able to transform into a blue phoenix, the fruit allows him to regenerate any wounds with fire. It is a power that is said to be even rarer than Logia. The fruit gave him his nickname: Marco the Phoenix. Marco has more control over his Devil Fruit than any other Zoan-user to date; it&#039;s so great that he can change just some limbs while the rest of the body remains human.\n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)",

Morgan is a very tall, intimidating man with white-blond hair and a steel jaw. As his nickname suggests, his right hand is replaced by a huge steel axe, the handle of which seems to go right through his forearm. Like most marines of high rank in the series, he wears a large, billowing coat like a cape. He can also normally be seen smoking a cigar.   Three years ago, Morgan looks much like he does in the present storyline, except without the axe hand and the metal jaw. He was also of a slimmer build than in the present storyline.   Prior to \"capturing\" Kuro, Morgan seemed to be a brave man who was not afraid of death. After his promotion, Morgan was corrupted by his power and became who he is today.   When Morgan is first introduced, he is governing over the small island of Shell Town, where his Naval base is located. Yet he is ruling by fear, abusing his rank to make people pay taxes, and even going as far as killing his own men if they do not obey his commands. He has a very spoiled son named Helmeppo, who is just as bad at using his father's rank to get what he wants from the island's inhabitants. Morgan shows no sort of fatherly love for Helmeppo, even stating that Helmeppo was a worthless son not even worth hitting.   Morgan's obsession with rank is proven in his battle against Luffy, where, despite not being able to to land a single blow on the rubberman (and having taken several), he would not accept defeat.

In his past life he was known as 'the Demon of the Frozen Land', having conquered and mercilessly ruled over many countries and islands over five-hundred years ago. His 'rebirth' as a zombie is an event of great importance to the crew of Thriller Bark. In order to make Oars the strongest zombie ever created, Gecko Moria implants the shadow of Straw Hat Luffy into the zombie's body.  Having Luffy's shadow in his body, Oars's attacks have names similar to Luffy's moves (Gomu Gomu no Scythe, Gomu Gomu no Volcano). Though he is initially incapable of stretching his body, he gains this ability when Gecko Moira takes control of his body. Despite his immense size, Oars is extremely fast, moving so quick that he almost disappears for an instant before unleashing an attack. Making matters worse, small doses of salt have no effect on him because of his size.   ~!Oars is ultimately defeated by the combined efforts of the entire Straw Hat crew, after several unsuccessful attempts.

He commands the soldier sect of zombies on Thriller Bark, and his subordinates have a tendency of making fun of his perverted nature, referring to him as &quot;Erosalom&quot; (Perv-salom). Although first revealed as an invisible man, his true form is that of a man with various animal parts surgically implanted onto his person by Dr. Hogback. These animal parts include a lion's face, the thick skin of an elephant and the condensed muscles of various bears and gorillas. He has eaten the Suke Suke no mi (Clear Clear fruit), which allows him to turn invisible on demand and to turn objects or persons invisible if he touches them. He uses this ability to conceal a pair of bazookas strapped to his arms, which allows him to fire blasts which seem to to come from nowhere. The blasts are incredibly powerful, capable of mowing down trees and setting fiery explosions. Like many other characters in One Piece, Absalom has a unique laugh, his is a growl-like garurururu.

Once it is discovered that the crew has not paid Skypiea's exorbitant toll, however, she regretfully follows the mandatory commands from their &quot;god&quot; Enel, which has been placed upon all her people under pain of death.

Even so, Rockstar wanted to fight Whitebeard to reclaim his honor, but Shanks told him it was no big deal and to pull back.",

      "description": "When he first appeared Koby was a small, timid, bespectacled boy with pink hair. He was slightly chubby and somewhat shorter than Luffy. After training with Garp, Koby became somewhat thinner and taller. He now stands nearly as tall as Luffy. He also gained a scar across his forehead above his right eye. He now wears a jacket with the standard Marine colors.   Personality  Koby is first introduced as a cowardly Chore Boy on board Alvida's ship. Through fear of being smashed by her Iron Mace, whenever she asked him who was the loveliest on the sea, he would reply, 'You are, Miss Alvida'. Eventually with the help of Luffy he found the courage to pursue his dream of leaving her and becoming a Marine.  The first time he appears to have changed is when he and Luffy arrive at the base Captain Morgan is at. Helmeppo holds a gun to his head, but he pulls together his courage and tells Luffy not to worry about him. After their mini-arc series, Helmeppo and he become good friends.  Koby values his friendship with Luffy a lot, as shown when even after their brief fight, he asks if they're still friends.  Abilities and Powers  In his first appearance he lacked any fighting skills. According to Alvida, the only reason why she kept him on was because he happened to be good at Navigation. He is seen during his mini-arc training alongside Helemeppo and Vice-Admiral Monkey D. Garp. He has since become strong enough to use Rokushiki, or at the very least, Soru. He also has some knowledge of swordsmanship, as he was seen practicing with Helmepppo, as well as Garp's attendant.    ~! Current Events  He appears to be at Water 7 alongside Helmeppo after Garp pays Luffy a visit. He tells both Luffy and Zoro about \"The New World\", and also tells them that the next time they met, it will be in the New World, and that he will be an Admiral and he will have to fight and capture Luffy. Luffy just says he'll look forward to their fight.  Koby sees Luffy one more time as he leaves Water 7, when Garp attacks.   Koby makes another appearance later on, in the Marineford Arc, participating in the war alongside the marines. After shouting a plea to end the war, he is attacked by Admiral Akainu, only to faint before being saved by Shanks. Sometime during the timeskip, he was hailed as the hero of the rocky port incident, where he protected civilians from a former member of the Rocks Pirates. He has also been shown to be a member of the marine organization SWORD. He is currently in captivity on pirate island in the New World. !~",

Drake how many people he had slain in his very first appearance, and had no qualms about flipping his middle finger at Eustass Kid, the most wanted Supernova on the Archipelago (even smiling defiantly when doing so). However, he hates being ordered around. He is also unfailingly polite, usually referring to others as \"Mr\", and appears to be honorable enough to refuse taking credit that is due to others.",

He stood by his story even up till his execution.  Norland was a brown haired man whose most distinct feature is a large chestnut on his head. This feauture was passed down to his descendants.  He was a well built man who often wore a black coat and orange scarf.  After his execution, Norland's image was distorted over the years due to the shame that was brought to his name. Since then, whenever someone refers to Norland, the image of an ever smiling idiot is the one that commonly comes into mind.  This defacing image is the one often drawn by artists in children's books. His nose is shaped like a spork.     The real Norland was a honest and good man who was brave and cared about people, despite what history remembers him as. He was happy-go-lucky and had a strong determination as well as being friendly. His only flaw seemed to have been acting without consulting people on things (such as cutting down the Shandians sacred trees), however he only did what he thought was (and usually is) best for people.    The Norland who is depicted in the stories is a grinning fool who often went away on long expeditions only to return with stories that seemed unbelievable. In the end as far as the story was concerned, Norland pushed his luck with the bragging of a whole city of gold and it was a lie that cost him his dearly his life.",

Besides his head and shoulders which are covered in armor, he wears an open leather jacket, black pants, cowboy boots, and a long fur cape.  Underneath his iron mask, Duval surprisingly looks exactly like Sanji's badly drawn wanted poster. Except for his eyebrow which swirls downward instead of upward like Sanji's, he is an exact duplicate to the drawing. Because of this appearance, he had a lot of trouble with the marines and bounty hunters, and thus had to conceal his face in order to protect himself. While Duval received alot of injuries because of this, his most devastating one is a scar on his back which he states is very painful.  Upon confronting Sanji in order to get revenge, Duval got his entire facial structure rearranged by Sanji's kicks. The result of such a crude and violent operation was a complete successful makeover. Due to Sanji's kicks, Duval's entire face had been rearranged into a handsome one completely different from the one he originally had. He absolutely loves it for the benefits it gives. Though turned handsome, Duval however has a hard time winking and thus his eyes would often not wink in unison.",

She is a former pirate alongside her companion Rayleigh and is also known for once being chased by notable marine Monkey D. Garp.  Shakky is very smart, and seems to constantly seek information - particularly on other pirates. She also reads the newspapers in what one could assume to be an obsessive manner, as she believes strongly that knowledge is power. She was the one who informed Luffy of all of the nine other pirates whose bounties exceed one hundred million beli.  She also seems intent on keeping her age a secret; Luffy asked her how old she was when he heard that she had quit being a pirate forty years ago, but she immediately changed the subject. After meeting Luffy for a short time, she is impressed by him, and states that she's rooting for him to become the Pirate King.   She gave up the life of a pirate forty years ago to open a bar. She is infamous for charging exuberant prices for her goods, however she makes an exception for Hatchan and the Strawhats.   ~!The Straw Hats return from the Human Auctioning House, where they found Rayleigh, and the tells the group about Roger's fate. Currently, she is taking care of the wounded Hatchan, as the Straw Hats depart. Unknown to her, Camie, Pappug and Hatchan, Bartholomew Kuma teleported the Straw Hats away from the Sabaody Archipelago to different locations. While it was getting late and the Straw Hats have not been heard of since they left, Camie began to worry about their safety. While Pappug and Hatchan were convinced they'll be fine, Shakuyaku on the contrary, pointed out that their chances of facing a Marine Admiral and escaping are slim, and noted that the current era is slowly changing, so the Straw Hats must catch and hold on to \"the waves\" that will inevitably wash it away to survive.!~\n~!She is the former Empress of Amazon Lily from 2 Generations preceding Boa Hancock, as well as a former captain of the Kuja Pirates.!~",

On his broad chin he has a &quot;X&quot; and on his chest and upper body he also has another large &quot;X&quot;.\n\nWhen seen from above, his bicorne greatly resembles the head of a Pterodactyl. He wears armor on his legs and arms consisting of knee-high boots and gloves that go up past his elbows. On the rest of his body he wears leather pants and a leather shirt; a belt with a large ornately designed circular belt buckle secures Drake&#039;s pants. He also wears a black cape, which, from the inside, is crimson-colored, with a fur coating around the neck.    \n\nLike his fellow Supernova, Basil Hawkins, Drake appears to be a pirate who abhors needless violence especially if he knows it would cause too much attention     Though he carries a four bladed axe as part of his weaponry, he is also known for swordsmanship. The sword he is seen wielding is a rapier-like sword. His skill is enough that he was capable of interrupting the fight of two other Supernovas with just one move.     \n\nHe has also achieved physical strength to the degree where he was able to kick aside a &quot;copy&quot; of the Warlord, Bartholomew Kuma.     \n\nAs a former Marine, Drake has a deep understanding of the workings of the World Government, and is able to use this knowledge to protect himself from danger and predict the movements of the Marines.

He enjoys seeing others laughing and having fun and encouraged Robin to laugh.  He was one of the three people who influenced Nico Robin, Saul wears a cowboy hat which Robin would wear herself. He encouraged Robin to laugh even if it hurts which explains why she smiles at the time of trouble. Because of his middle name, this explains how Robin knows about the Will of D, she even told Luffy later why would he fight, the will of D.  Saul and Vice Admiral Kuzan (later known as Admiral Aokiji) also had a good friendship, and they both shared the same sight on Moral Justice.

Because of Crocodile's actions and lack of compassion, Chaka was angered to the point that he attacked Crocodile out of rage, but his reasons were also backed by an attempt to protect Vivi and Kohza, as well as buy them time to put an end to the battle - but despite his efforts, he was easily defeated. He survived, however, and showed up later on in the Arabasta arc commanding the royal guard to stop fighting, and later appeared at Pell's grave.

Throughout her life, Kuina pushed herself harder then usual in kendo in order to be accepted in the male-dominated discipline. Even her father thought that she could never be the best because she was a girl. While training in the same dojo, Kuina was the only person Zoro was never able to beat in a sword fight. After overhearing what her father said about girls not being good at kendo one night, she rushed to find Zoro and challenged him to a duel, with real swords. Though she defeated Zoro again (she was the best in the dojo, he was second-best), she still felt like everyone was looking down on her just because she was a girl. So she and Zoro make a promise that they would continue to build their skills until they were the best swordsmen in the world, after which they would fight each other again for the title of strongest. Original owner of Zoro&#039;s white sword, Watto. \n\n~!Kuina dies the very next day by falling down some stairs, breaking her neck.

Helmeppo then came in and took them away from her rudely, saying that if she gave them to Zoro it would be as if she were the accomplice of a criminal, but he then spit them out complaining that the onigiri had sugar in them instead of salt. Helmeppo then ordered the naval marine standing behind him to throw her out and he reluctantly does so, but luckily, Rika was caught by Luffy before anything bad could happen. The reason Zoro was imprisoned by the Marines was because he defended Rika when she was nearly attacked by Helmeppo's pet wolf. Because Helmeppo saw this as a crime towards himself, he ordered Zoro to stay imprisoned for thirty days. Zoro, not wanting to cause any more trouble, accepted.  \n\nRika later becomes friends with both Helmeppo and Koby during their stay in Shell Town, and becomes upset when the two leave with Vice-Admiral Garp. She later appeared in a filler as well as TV Special 4 and where she is friends with Ninjin, Piman and Tamanegi.  Her only known relative is her mother, the bartender Ririka.",

She dresses in a very skimpy devil-themed outfit. She carries around a pitchfork and wears a headpiece that resembles horns. She has long hair that covers her eyes. She also wears candle-shaped earrings.     As her name suggests, Sadi-chan is a sadistic person who enjoys bringing pain and torture to others, including Marine allies, and can't seem to get enough of their screams. She also seems to have extreme pride in the virtually perfect defenses of Impel Down, and refuses the assistance of the Marines.    She also tends to add an &quot;mmmmm--!?&quot; in the middle of her sentences, and insists to be addressed as &quot;Sadi-chan&quot;, which is to correct people in case they think the &quot;-chan&quot; is an honorific (which is not, but is part of her name).     Sadi-chan is a chief guard of Impel Down with some authority over lower ranking subordinates. She appears to be in command over the Four Demon Guards.    The pitchfork she carries around conceals a custom-designed whip which she can use quite.    (c) onepiece.wikia.com",

On Smoker's ship, he unwittingly reveals some information about Baroque Works. In the second, the ship is in Arabasta.  When an unforeseen event happens that causes the crew, including Smoker, to leave their ship, Mr. 11 tries to free himself. Surprisingly, \"Billions\" (henchmen for Officer Agents) board the ship. Mr. 11, mistaking them for \"Millions\", (henchmen for Frontier Agents) yells at them to untie him. The \"Billions\" then reveal their rank and are hence the same level as him (agents above ranked of 10 are not much stronger than the Billions). Then Mr. 11 apologizes, but too little too late for they have no intention of freeing him. Then \"Mr. Mellow\" comes toward Mr. 11 and says \"It's about time a post got opened.\" and shoots Mr. 11. Though his death isn't shown, Mr. Mellow's comment makes it a likely possibility, especially as Tashigi tells Smoker he was murdered in the same chapter/episode.  (Source: One Piece Wikia)",

Kira Kira no Mi (Twinkle-Twinkle Fruit)!~\n__Devil Fruit Type:__ ~!Paramecia!~\n\nJozu is the commander of Whitebeard&#039;s 3rd division. As the commander of the 3rd division of the Whitebeard Pirates, Jozu has authority over the lower-ranking subordinates. He was one of the few men unaffected by the powerful Haki released by the Yonkou Shanks. He is very experienced and a veteran of the Whitebeard pirates from the times of Gol D. Roger.    He is one of the strongest members of the Whitebeard Pirates, as shown by his position as the 3rd division commander. During the Marineford war, Jozu was powerful enough to fight on par against the Shichibukai and the Marine Admirals.     Jozu has outstanding brute strength, comparable to that of the Giant Squad Marines. He picked up and hurled an immense iceberg at a great distance at the giants protecting Marineford. The iceberg was so enormous that it appeared to be at least ten times as big as any of the giants. Thus, Jozu has demonstrated one of the greatest strength feats seen in the series. And, despite his massive body, his speed and reflexes are on par with his brute force; when he attacked Crocodile after the latter attempted to take Whitebeard&#039;s life, Crocodile commented on both the great speed and strength of the attack.     Jozu has eaten a currently unnamed Devil Fruit that allows him to transform, parts and most likely all of his body, into diamond. This power has earned him the nickname  &quot;Diamond Jozu&quot;. It is currently unknown if this is a Paramecia, like Supa Supa no Mi.    Jozu&#039;s powers give him the ability to greatly increase his offensive and defensive powers. His already strong physical attacks are enhanced by the density of his diamond body. His defenses seem to enhance exponentially, and he is able to block the strongest slash in the world from the world&#039;s greatest swordsman, Shichibukai Juracule Mihawk, with no visible damage to himself. However, when his whole body is not in full diamond form, he is still vulnerable to Aokiji&#039;s freezing abilities. Other than that, Jozu is weak against the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses.\n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)",

Lulu fights with double-weapons, although what weapons he uses change at times; he has been seen fighting with swords, guns, and saws, though he tends to stick with swords later in the story. Lulu constantly has part of his hair sticking up. When he tries to push it down, it always pops up somewhere else, such as the other side of his head, his mustache, and other people's heads. In most situations this is simply humorous, with other characters looking at him funny for it or simply ignoring the oddness. However, at times it actually comes in handy; in battle, Lulu can make the hair come out of somebody's nose to distract them, leaving them open for him to attack.\n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)",

While he hated humans, Tiger did not discriminate when it came to slaves and thus also freed slaves of all races there as well. Among these other slaves were Boa Hancock and her two sisters.   With the Fishmen slaves he freed, Tiger changed the shameful hoof mark branded on them signifying slavery, into a symbol of sun and took them in. With them, he created the Sunny Pirates.   At some point in time however, Fisher Tiger somehow died and his command of the Sunny Pirates was given to Jinbei.\n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)",

He has almost a cleft lip-like mouth and an unique hairstyle. His nose is also colored red, it is long just like the nose of Kaku and Usopp. With these characteristics, they make him look like a fox. Foxy typically wears yellow orange suspenders and a coat. His coat is colored purple in the anime, while it is colored silver in the manga and other manga related media.   \n\n__Personality:__  Foxy is a cheater and trickster, who participates in the Davy Back Fight, a contest between pirate crews where the winning team can steal crew members from the losing team. Most members of Foxy's crew joined him because he won them in this contest. However, they seem to be genuinely enthusiastic about being in the Foxy pirates, and wholeheartedly cheer on their crewmates and captain in the Davy Back Fight.  Though he acts supremely confident most of the time and seems quite fond of himself, Foxy is extremely sensitive to insults or criticism. Any offensive words from others cause him to instantly become depressed, and he usually ends up losing his footing and falling to the ground, barely supporting himself with his arms, while a black cloud suddenly appears over his head. Luckily for Foxy, all it takes is a few kind words from anybody to perk him up again. In the anime, Nami and Usopp used this weakness to their advantage by alternately hurling insults and compliments at Foxy non-stop, leaving him emotionally (as well as physically) paralyzed and unable to help his team during the roller race.   \n\n__Abilities and Powers:__  Foxy is a cunning character who uses his Devil Fruit powers as well as various other tricks to aid in him cheating. He also seems to have an extraordinary sense of time, even when he had slowed down multiple cannonballs he still knew exactly when each and everyone of them was going to regain fullspeed.  \n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)",

      "description": "__Devil Fruit:__ Doku Doku no Mi (Venom-Venom Fruit)\n\n__Appearance:__ \nMagellan is a large man that greatly resembles a devil. He has bat wings, and a gargoyle-like face. He has horn-like ornaments on his head which he can pull out and use as weapons. Underneath them, he has short black twintail-styled hair. He towers over a regular sized person greatly. He also has very sharp teeth and his hands closely resemble those of the Blue Gorillas.\n\n__Personality:__ \nMagellan is a man with a rather distinct problem. Because of the powers of the Doku Doku no Mi, he delights in eating poisoned food. Though immune to the poison, he suffers from a severe case of diarrhea brought on from ingesting such poisonous meals. As a result, he spends approximately ten hours each day in the bathroom relieving himself. He is actually agoraphobic and enjoys dark, enclosed spaces.  Though he only performs roughly four hours of duty as Warden of Impel Down due to his insistence to eat poisonous foods, despite the severe diarrhea, he still takes his role of keeping the prisoners in check seriously, and does not tolerate their bad behaviors. As he has permission to execute any one of them he sees fit, he shows no hesitation to drench them in his Hydra&#039;s lethal poison. Magellan also takes great pride in keeping Impel Down&#039;s reputation of being impenetrable and inescapable, and felt personally insulted when Monkey D. Luffy besmirched that record since Kinjishi the &quot;Flying Pirate&quot; 20 years ago.  Magellan seems to find it amusing whenever someone he doesn&#039;t particularly like gets poisoned or suffocated by his powers, evident when he was seen chuckling at Hannyabal after he sighed a poisonous mist at the latter&#039;s direction. While he also does not tolerate Hannyabal&#039;s &quot;poisonous&quot; (the actual term used is punned with the word &quot;distant&quot;) comments he himself is prone to use them against himself. His ruthlessness applies not only to the prisoners, but also to his own men, as seen berating a guard who was accidentally poisoned by his Hydra.  Despite his ruthlessness and seriousness, Magellan was one of the many to fall for Boa Hancock&#039;s beauty, and neglected to hear the report of Luffy&#039;s intrusion when she requested to see Ace immediately, being completely head-over-heels over her.\n\n__Devil Fruit:__ \nMagellan had eaten the Doku Doku no Mi, a Devil Fruit that allows him to generate and manipulate poison. Magellan can produce these poison in different strength and forms, such as breathing simple minor gas to put subordinates in place, blowing tear gas bubbles to stun the opponents, or create extremely fatal liquid poison. His most infamous technique that is well known to most prisoners within the walls of Impel Down is a three-headed dragon called the Hydra, which is composed of corrosive liquid poison that causes lethal nerve-paralysis and melts the victims at the same time. His Hydra also had the power to easily defeat the Blackbeard Pirates with little to no effort.  Because of the fruit&#039;s powers, Magellan is also able to eat poisoned food without killing himself, where instead it gives the food flavor. However, while he is immune to the poison, the food instead causes him to have diarrhea. This being a problem as he loves to eat poisoned food.",

In English, his name means \"Red Dog.\"  Akainu is a firm believer in \"Absolute Justice\", going as far as destroying the refugee ship simply due to the possibility of even one scholar sneaking on board. His logic is that if even one of the scholars of Ohara had escaped with it, the mission would've been a failure, much to the dismay of Aokiji, who called him a fool for overdoing things. As an Admiral, Akainu is able to command vast number of Marine troops that are under his rank. Most of all, he has the ability to order a Buster Call attack on any island. In addition to this, given that he holds the same rank as Kizaru and Aokiji, it can be assumed that he commands comparable fighting abilities to those two.  He has the devil fruit ability where he is able to transform his body into magma.   \n\n~!During the timeskip, Sakazuki was nominated for the position of fleet admiral after Sengoku had retired. Kuzan, however, was against the idea of having him become the new fleet admiral and the two admirals battled each other for the position on Punk Hazard. Sakazuki ended up as the victor of that battle, although both men were seriously wounded. Sakazuki, however, decided to let Kuzan live because they were comrades. After becoming fleet admiral, Sakazuki decided to relocate the Marine Headquarters to the New World in exchange for the Marine branch.!~",

Musse went willing to the altar to save all her people. Just before their God devoured her, Montblanc Norland appeared and killed the giant snake who tried to convince the Shandians that this plague was curable and not a curse from the gods.  During the time Norland spent trying to find the cure, both her and his men were locked up in cages, she spoke to the men on who their captain was. After a struggle against time, Norland brought the cure back and the Shandians were saved. Musse now free and knowing the truth, was seen later sobbing in her mothers arms over the events that had happened.  However, her tribe found that their forest which they found sacred has been chopped down by Norland and his men, and they were once again ostracized by the tribe. She later explained to one of Norland's crew as to why the Shandians are treating him this way, and after she learned they cleared the forest because it originated the plague in the village, she quickly rushed to tell the villagers, and they rang the golden bell as hard as they could to inform Norland of their regret, and her father Calgara rushed towards Norland before he and his men set sail to ask for his forgiveness. Three years later, she is married to Seto.\n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)",

Shelly however was later captured by Foxy, which prompted the Davy Back Fight. After Luffy finally beat Foxy, Aokiji appeared and used his Devil Fruit powers to freeze all of the water on the island for a week, allowing Tonjit to ride his horse Shelly across the water in order to meet up with his clan. In the anime, instead of Aokiji, Tonjit&#039;s grandson appeared from the ground, riding a mule which gave Tonjit transport.  Tonjit&#039;s clothing, nomadic lifestyle, his horse, and his dwelling in a yurt seems to be based on the lifestyles of the nomadic peoples of Central Asia (specifically Mongolia.)\n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)",

He is among the several New World pirates aiding the Whitebeard Pirates in saving Ace.   Like Oars, he is a giant larger than regular sized giants. He also wears three skulls together, except as a necklace. His overall shape and silhouette resembles Oars. Among his effects is notably a gigantic kasa that Ace made for him.  Oars Jr. seems to be a very good person at heart. As shown in flashbacks, he was very carefree, and appreciated little things, such as the straw hat Ace made for him. He is also shown to be very determined, as he went straight through the enemy lines to rescue Ace, even continuing on after one of his legs was lopped off by Doflamingo. Oars Jr. has had some positive relationship with Ace in the past. The most prevalent sign of this relationship is the gigantic kasa that Ace gave to him. For Ace&#039;s kindness, Oars Jr. is determined to save Ace. As a giant of immense size, Oars Jr. has incredible strength. However, in contrast to Oars he is seen using a sword. Oars Jr. has a high amount a stamina, taking damage from three Shichibukai (one of whom sliced off his right leg), incoming marines, their Giants Squad and the marines&#039; artillery without losing his resolve to save Ace. However, his large size was also apparently his own weakness, as he was so big it made him an easy target.",

She is one of the many pirates allied with Whitebeard who have journeyed to Marineford to rescue Ace.  She commands a ship that is an icebreaker. It is capable of going through ice covered waters.  Upon learning that Ace was going to executed, Whitey Bay and her crew joined forces with several other pirates and Whitebeard&#039;s crew to rescue Ace. Arriving at Marineford, as the war with the Marines began, the pirate alliance found their ships frozen at sea by Aokiji. This setback however didn&#039;t stop Whitey Bay and her crew. Due to their ship being an icebreaker, they simply broke through the ice. As they sailed, they created another opening in the Marine&#039;s formations for which Whitebeard and his allies could progress through aside the opening created by Oars Jr. earlier.    \n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)",

She is presumed dead since Akainu blew up the refugee ship.    She was first mentioned in chapter 391, [2] and was seen later in a small flashback [3]. She was last seen fully, yelling angrily for Robin when she found the bread and jam gone.    After that she appeared in small flashbacks. [4].\n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)",

Unfortunately, since Sanji&#039;s wanted poster does not look like Sanji, Moria and his minions took Sanji&#039;s identity for granted. They even mistook him as having no bounty at all. As a result, Sanji&#039;s shadow wasn&#039;t given a strong zombie body and as a counterpart wasn&#039;t included in the Zombie General ranks, his combat abilities though were praised by other zombies to be on par. He uses Sanji&#039;s Fighting Style     Upon seeing Nami in danger, he deliberately stopped the other Zombie Animals from harming her. He stated that even if it would disobey his master, he will not allow a woman to be harmed. His strength in defending Nami from the other Zombie Animals was apparently so great that they started to compare him with the Zombie Generals. The newcomer, despite his efforts, was however defeated by Absalom.     Later, he becomes more obedient. He was able to hold down Robin and Chopper, while he was being helped by Jigorou.     Even though no ego was left, he still couldn&#039;t get along with Jigorou, who has Zoro&#039;s shadow. They got in a fight over orders. Hogback unintentionally ordered both to jump out of the building, which both did.     After having jumped off the building, Sanji&#039;s shadow was later taken out of Inuppe and absorbed by Moria along with the other shadows he implanted in his zombie minions.\n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)",

With his Devil Fruit powers active, Dalmatian takes the form of a muscular, bipedal dalmatian-human hybrid. The top part of his head from his nose up, along with his arms and legs, are that of a dalmatian: a white dog with black spots all over the body. He also has a long tail. However, the bottom half of his face is human, and has a blond-white beard on a wide chin. His torso and neck also seem to remain human. He has yet to be seen in his default human or full dalmatian forms.    Like all other Vice Admirals and other high ranking officers, he wears a double breasted suit, dress shirt and tie, with a Marine jacket draped loosely over his shoulders like a cape. His suit, in particular, is dark green. He wore a light red shirt underneath, with a darker red tie.     Dalmatian has eaten a Zoan-class Devil Fruit that allows him to transform into a dalmatian. Using this, he can increase his fighting prowess and physical strength greatly, and, combined with his Rokushiki style, favors his status as a martial artist greatly. His transformation into a human-dalmatian hybrid seems to differ from other Zoan users, as parts of his body (the bottom half of his face, his neck and torso) remain human while the rest become the animal, whereas the other users&#039; bodies take on complete animal characteristics in their hybrid form.    \n\n(Source: One Piece Wikia)",

He is an admirer and fanatical believer of Arlong's ideals.  Hody is a racist, overly hypocritical, prideful, brutal and vicious natured fishman who, like many of his kind, hates humans for leaving Fisher Tiger to die when he could have been saved (which was not true, as Tiger refused human blood due to being betrayed). He proves this by attacking humans within his reach. He, like Arlong, believes that fishmen are the supreme race, showing his arrogance by attacking Gyro's crew with his hands cuffed, showing them that they could easily be destroyed even with the handicap. He then deliberately released the crew, injured but alive, setting them as examples, telling them to spread the word of the New Fishman Pirates.  Despite the fact that they both looked down on humans, his treatment of humans is even more brutal than Arlong's. He considers his human captives to be expendable and sees them as nothing more than pawns, while Arlong had left humans alone so long as they paid him the \"tribute\" money periodically. Arlong mainly killed humans to make examples of them when they did not pay up and was content with leaving them be, aside from odd acts to make sure the humans knew who was boss, but Hody will use them as part of his plan that will almost ensure their deaths, and threatening to kill them outright if they refuse, giving them very little chance to live altogether.",

He is very loyal to Perona and, while Perona finds him cute, she dislikes his voice, so whenever he tries to speak, Perona will silence him. In the anime, Perona&#039;s point is further justified as Kumashi is given a rather uncute voice. Kumashi, however, is always on her side, no matter how strict she is.",

Monet is also quite diligent, as she explained to Caesar how the Straw Hat Pirates' real strength might be above their current bounties. Monet is also rather sadistic, seemingly enjoying the suffering of others such as chuckling at Law's pain from encountering Vergo. She is also rather flirtatious, such as flirting with Law when he returned to the lab and even thought about a date when he said he needed her.

      "description": "__Devil Fruit:__ Gasu Gasu no Mi\n\nCaesar Clown, also referred to as \"Master\" by his underlings, is a former colleague of Vegapunk and the main antagonist of the Punk Hazard Arc. Caesar is the leading expert on mass-murder weapons and is a mad scientist with a bounty of 300,000,000 beli on his head.  He appears to have a grudge against Vegapunk, as well as a somewhat rational personality, as shown when he hid from the Marines instead of trying to fight them immediately, as well as trusting Monet's deduction that the Straw Hats might be more powerful than their bounties claim and waiting for Joker's approval to make his actions look like accidents, before starting attacks. Caesar is also a rather economizing person, as he didn't want to waste the poison, by clearing it off but rather collected, saved and compressed it into Smiley. It was stated by Smoker that he was one \"crazy bastard\".  He is a very prideful person, going as far to say that his work four years ago on the mass murdering weapon that caused the Punk Hazard incident was not a failure, but instead was a great success, hinting at a superiority complex. Unlike most Logia users, Caesar keeps his Devil Fruit power activated all the time and is either completely or partly turned into gas.   ~!He also demonstrates tendencies of a superiority complex when Luffy mentioned his Gasu Gasu no Mi had no effect on his immune system due to Magellan's Doku Doku no Mi, both being poisonous Devil Fruits of differentiating class, and Caesar became rapidly aggravated in the fact of Luffy comparing his Logia powers to that of a \"mere\" paramecia user.!~   ~!He is very ruthless, as he used the blind trust of his injured subordinates to test a newly developed gas and told the Yeti Cool Brothers to kill Brownbeard when he thought he was no use to him anymore. He also used the restricted drug NHC10 to maintain his hold on the children he kidnapped, knowing that they will be unable to escape due to the painful withdrawal symptoms; Law found this aspect of Caesar disgusting. Caesar also seems to like cocktails, as he is often seen holding a cocktail glass.!~  He has a distinct laugh of \"Shurororororo\".",

Kinemon seems to follow the code of bushido, claiming he would commit suicide if he could, for the disgrace of being dismembered without dying. He still tried to maintain his pride, even after being completely dismembered. He is also greatly honorable, such as bowing before Sanji (in Nami's body) for saving his torso and thanking him for helping him stating he was indebted to him.  \n\nHe is a very old fashioned samurai warrior who expects women to walk three steps behind men and talk gracefully and quietly. He on many occasions referred to Nami as a shameless, violent and obscene woman due to her careless behavior. He has a tendency to be quite perverted in spite of his old fashioned ideals. Though he seemed to be outraged at Nami's sense of fashion, he still greatly enjoyed ogling at her cleavage. He also has an extremely rude special ability of talking with his farts. He cares deeply for his son, Momonosuke, as he traveled to the dangerous Punk Hazard island and challenged one of the Shichibukai to find him. Even after being chopped to pieces, his torso and leg still attempted to look for his son, and attacked anything that got in the way. He seems to be unaware of Devil Fruits, as he said he ate a strange fruit, instead of stating the correct name.   \n~!He is the leader of the Nine Red Scabbards, the husband of Tsuru, and a former thug, He is also not the real father of Momonosuke, they pretend to be father and son in order to protect Momonosuke from his enemies, the Donquixote Pirates and the Beasts Pirates. \nDespite the two not being related, the Straw Hat Pirates noted that they looked alike and shared the same perverted traits.!~",

Because of his duplicitous conduct and allegiances he can be considered the secondary antagonist of the Punk Hazard Arc. Through his short discussion with Trafalgar Law, Vergo proved himself to be a shrewd man due to his mistrust of Caesar Clown, having Monet placed on the island to monitor his actions. He can also come across as somewhat condescending, mocking Law's position by pretending to have some respect for the Shichibukai. Seeing himself as above the Shichibukai, Vergo quickly reminds Law of the difference in their power by beating him unconscious. He's also shown to be a person who demands respect from others, such as when he demanded that Law refer to him as Vergo-san. While around citizens, Vergo is said to be an amiable person, much unlike the other G-5 Marines. The parents of the children kept on Punk Hazard trusted Vergo's words that all of the missing children died in an accident. His statement caused them to partly believe that they were truly gone, though some parents still believe that their children are alive. Easily deceiving both citizens and the entire Marines organization, Vergo has proven himself to be highly manipulative. Despite his perceived intelligence however, Vergo can at times seems to lapse into moments of air-headedness such as when he claimed to Caesar Clown that he had been enjoying coffee and cookies, only to be reminded shortly after that there had never been any cookies to begin with.   \n\nVergo stated that his favorite food is hamburgers. He appears to be a very messy eater, as he was first shown to have the hamburger still on the side of his cheek.",

Once the military chief of the former Aoi Kingdom, he was conscripted through a World Military Draft during the two-year timeskip, being appointed to fill one of the Admiral vacancies caused by Kuzan's resignation and Sakazuki's promotion alongside his co-worker Ryokugyu. A proponent of \"Moral Justice\", he notably spearheaded a campaign to abolish the Seven Warlords of the Sea system. Fujitora was first mentioned by Sakazuki when the latter was first discussing plans to deal with Monkey D. Luffy and Trafalgar Law. His primary goal is to protect people, telling a subordinate that it is more important to take into account the number of lives to protect rather than the number of enemies against them. He takes care to never put innocent civilians in harm's way during conflict and will try to avoid causing collateral damage with his attacks; when he does inflict such damage he makes sure to compensate the owner of the involved property.\n\nIn his devil fruit's name, Zushi Zushi is a Japanese onomatopoeia that describes a \"thump\" or \"thud\" sound, representing the footfall of something heavy, e.g. stomps of sumo wrestlers.\n\nHis blindness is a result of him intentionally inflicting damage on his eyes out of sorrow for all the evil he had seen",

He acted as an ally to the Straw Hat Pirates in his undercover role in the Dressrosa Arc and Zou Arc, but became an antagonist in the Wano Country Arc after showing his true colors. According to Orochi, due to Kanjuro being raised in the theatre, his main purpose in life is to act as someone else. Due to his parents dying during the persecution of his family, Kanjuro wishes to avenge them and then die.!~",

Nola can transmit venom through its fangs; the venom is powerful enough to instantly corrode trees.\n\n~!When the snake slammed headfirst into base of the immensely large Giant Jack at high speed after the beanstalk had been slightly weakened by Zoro, the force was strong enough to slightly tilt it. Despite Nola's size, the snake can move very quickly, making it very difficult for its prey to elude it. Nola's scales are extremely tough and durable, as Wyper was unable to damage it even with multiple blasts of his powerful Burn Bazooka. However, a large thunderbolt from Enel proved powerful enough to knock Nola unconscious.\nNola can transmit venom through its fangs; the venom is powerful enough to instantly corrode trees.!~",
