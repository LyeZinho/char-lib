As a young child his mother remarried, to an Italian man, and they moved to Italy; hence Haruno Shiobana became Giorno Giovanna.    \n\nGiorno's great ambition in life is to become a mafia boss (a \"Gang Star\"), and as such he eventually joins the mob squad Passione. Though he is its youngest and newest member, he quickly proves his mettle and eventually becomes the de facto leader of the group. Unlike typical mafia bosses, he wanted to give divested riches to the poor, giving him an agenda similar to Robin Hood. He eventually influences all of Passione, ~!all but their boss, who later became their worst enemy.!~",

It uses a radar to detect an enemy's position. It's radar detects only CO2, which makes it a problem when there is a big crowd.  Like Bruno, Narancia delivers his finishing line in segments. He'll say \"Vola, vola, vola...\" during his rapid-fire attack and end with \"Volare Via\" (Italian for \"Fly Away\") when he finishes.  While not a direct translation of the word, Narancia's name is derived from \"arancia\" which is Italian for \"blood orange\" His education doesn't extend past elementary school, a fact that he gets angered when people mention it. His favorite TV show is the anime Fist of the North Star.",

Afterwards, Giorno convinces Bucciarati to help him overthrow the boss of \"Passione\", in a plot to take over the gang. Eventually defecting from \"Passione\", Buccellati leads a group of rogue gang members against the boss, who is revealed to be a man named Diavolo.  As a child, Bruno was born in a poor fishing village, but he looked up to his father because of the love he had for his family. When his father became mixed up in the drug business and was badly injured, Bruno protected his father from the people that were trying to kill him, by killing them himself. This led him into the world of gangsters. Even though he was a member of \"Passione\", he had a kind personality; many people came to him for help.  Sticky Fingers is the name of Bucciarati's Stand. It has the ability to place a fully functional zipper with a touch. For example: Sticky Fingers can hit a wall, placing a zipper on it. It can then open the zipper, allowing entrance through or into the wall. Its ability is not limited to inanimate objects; it can be used on humans. Bucciarati is able to use its ability on himself. Its ability can also be used offensively, to take things apart, or to mismatch things.  \n\nBucciarati delivers his catch phrase while his Stand beats his opponents senseless with its fists. He begins stringing \"Ari ari ari\" to its rapid punches, saying \"Arrivederci\" on finish; \"Arrivederci\" meaning \"Goodbye\" in Italian.",

His birth is a mystery because his mother claimed that he was conceived two years before her sentence and all the guards were female. \n\nDiavolo was raised by a priest in his mother's hometown of Sardinia because she can't raise him while in prison. When he turned 19, when the priest was constructing an apartment for Diavolo, he found his mother buried alive under a stone tablet. Around the same time, a fire broke out and the priest and Diavolo were among the seven who died in the fire. However, in reality Diavolo survived and joined Passione soon after. \n\nDuring that time, Diavolo recovered the bow and six Arrows in Egypt and quickly ran off with them. He then sold five of the Arrows to Enya Geil and kept the remaining one for himself (that same arrow was attached to Polpo's Black Sabbath). Between Stardust Crusaders and Golden Wind, he sets out to kill all his blood relatives, and those who discover his identity, to ensure his name is erased from existence and he took the pseudonym Soliddo Nazo during his years in Passione. Diavolo means \"devil\" in Italian, fitting considering his personality and role as the main antagonist of Part 5.  \n\n__Stand:__ King Crimson - A light red humanoid whose face appears to have a smaller copy of itself in its forehead, perhaps to mirror Diavolo's psyche. King Crimson has the power to predict up to ten seconds into the future, and \"erase time\", effectively causing a time skip, where everything except itself and Diavolo is suddenly changed to be in the state they would have been a short time later (usually 3-10 seconds later). Time still flows normally for Diavolo, who can interact (or not interact, he can choose which objects to interact with) with the time-skipped objects for the amount of time that would have normally intervened (to Diavolo this appears in the form of the would-have-been intervening objects' states being superimposed on each other, in a fashion akin to Nude Descending a Staircase). The nature of the time skip is such that, for example, he predicts a bullet coming at him, and erases the time that it would have hit him in. To the viewer a bullet that would have hit Diavolo will suddenly be shifted to be on his other side as where it would be seconds later.!~",

Although he appears timid, he is actually even more dangerous than Prosciutto, which the heroes eventually find out the hard way.  His Stand is named Beach Boy (ビーチ・ボーイ Bīchi Bōi). This Stand takes the form of a fishing rod with a skull-shaped reel. The line can phase through any non-living thing, and sense living things in the immediate vicinity. The lure can also be affixed to a single place to await a victim. When a victim touches that area, Beach Boy will hook them, and begin burrowing into their body, usually aiming for the heart (Beach Boy is sensitive enough that Pesci can tell precisely where in the body the hook is). Any attack on the line itself is reflected back to the attacker.  Source: Wikipedia",

      "description": "Prosciutto is a member of La Squadra di Esecuzione. He is partnered with Pesci, who refers to Prosciutto as his \"big brother\" (or aniki), a title typically used by yakuza when addressing their superior. They try to assassinate Buccellati and his friends on a train headed to Florence.  His Stand is The Grateful Dead (ザ・グレイトフル・デッド（偉大なる死） Za Gureitofuru Deddo). A massive humanoid torso with no lower body. Instead, it trails wires from its \"waist\", and its entire surface is covered with evil-looking eyes. The eyes exude a vapor that rapidly accelerates living beings' aging. However, the aging is staved off by cold, meaning that women (who have a somewhat lower body temperature on average than men) age less rapidly, and, as Bucciarati discovers, one can completely avoid the effect by holding ice up to the affected areas. The aging process accelerates even further if The Grateful Dead actually makes physical contact with a victim. Prosciutto can choose whether he is affected; if so, his touch has the same effect as The Grateful Dead, and will reverse his own aging.  Source: Wikipedia",
