However, he can be driven by emotions for other people and become realistic and serious when a problem presents itself. Like most Manga archetypes, Gyro is incredibly intelligent when he needs to be. His most distinguishable body features are his long hair, western hat and his gold teeth which have \"GO! GO! ZEPPELI\" displayed on them, revealed whenever he smiles at someone. His signature laugh/chuckle is \"Nyo ho ho ho~\".  ~!Note that the \"Caesar\" in his name is pronounced in the traditional Greek way, more akin to the German \"Kaiser\". This is distinct from Caesar Anthonio Zeppeli from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 2, whose name is pronounced in the modern English way.!~",

He is a depressive man with a bleak outlook on life, but he is also very stubborn and capable of extreme, unwavering determination to the point of disregarding any risks or consequences, putting his goal above all else. He joins the Steel Ball Run race to find out the secret behind Gyro Zeppeli's steel balls, as Johnny believes they're capable of healing his legs.\n\nJohnny was once a horse racing prodigy. However, when waiting in line for a play, the girl he was with convinced him to cut to the front of the line and bribe the bouncers to throw out the youth in the front of the line, who had been waiting there all night. Furious, the youth shot Johnny in the back, paralyzing him from the waist down.\n\n~!Johnny earns a Stand named \"Tusk\" when they venture into the Devil's Palm as a result of their fight with Dio and Dr. Ferdinand. Tusk is able to fire Johnny's spinning fingernails similar to a revolver, with the nails having to take a few seconds to regrow. This long range attack becomes his primary means of defense. His Stand is small in size and has the same star-pattern over it as on Johnny's clothing, it appears to reside inside of him and only comes out to offer advice. It cannot speak, only make animal-like noises.  Later in the series, Johnny masters Gyro's \"Spin\" technique and uses it with his Stand's fingernail bullets; at one time, even being able to use it on himself. His Stand also evolves although remaining similar in appearance, now able to fire from the toenails on Johnny's paralyzed feet. !~",

He watches the competition from behind the curtains and hopes to gather the Saint's Corpse to use the Holy Relic to further the United States of America's interests and power, and explains that his way to do that is by \"taking the first napkin\". Valentine has a lot of importance for patriotism and seems to care about his country. Most of Valentine's bad deeds are not selfishly centered, but instead are done in order to achieve what he thinks is power for America, and to follow his goal of making America the most dominant country.\n\n~!Valentine is a Stand User.\nValentine's Stand, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (D4C), enables him access at any time to any number of alternate worlds/universes/dimensions; where if desired he may swap bodies with his counterparts, granting him pseudo-immortality. However, to activate said effect, Valentine must get caught between two objects (for example, a flag and the ground or a sofa and the wall). This limits D4C's ability but not by much since he has gotten caught between water and the bottom of the ocean as a method of using his ability before.\n\nValentine mostly uses an American Flag as his signature, and to active D4C's ability. He also has scars on his back resembling the old American Flag, as a result from him being tortured as a soldier.!~",

Able to discern the dark will to kill in people, Ringo prefers to duel people who won't hesitate to kill on the spot so that his duels are as tense and pure as possible.\n\nRingo's Stand, Mandom, enables him to reverse time by exactly 6 seconds by turning a hand on his wristwatch. Although it is very limited, its ability is critical for Ringo to win his duels.\n\n(Source: JoJo's Bizarre Encyclopedia)",

He has long bangs that are arranged on the left side of his face.\n\nHis outfit's most notable feature is the several roses near the top of his long main garment, which appears to be only slightly shorter than his coat and resembles a dress or tunic. He dons a long, hooded coat, gloves, kneepads, pants and boots. Everything but the coat and kneepads appears to be the same colour (depicted as deep red in digital colour).\n\nHe looks somewhat androgynous and seems to be wearing mascara - particularly below his eyes - and perhaps lipstick. \n\n(Source: JoJo's Bizarre Encyclopedia)",
