      "description": "The main character of the story. An isolated, lonely teenager who is forced to move when his family dies in a traffic accident. He is eighteen years old and stopped going to high school due to unknown reasons. He spends his time trolling and tricking on internet, as well as playing various RPGs. He sold his old house and moved into Green Home apartments (room 1410) because the money left by his deceased family was insufficient for him to survive as an isolated person. He then proceeds to chose October 25th as a date to commit suicide.\n\n~!Hyun is a human infected with the monsterization, but fights back against both his impending mutation and the monsters that have overtaken the world.!~ His weapon of choice is a handmade electric spear, powered by a large battery that he carries in his backpack.\n\nIt was revealed in chapters 81 and 82 that ~!Hyun had a rather happy childhood. Up until his high school years, he was the pride of his family. However, in high school he was targeted by a rich bully who made sure that Hyun was socially excluded. Eventually, even his own sister started excluding him by claiming that he wasn't her brother. His parents took little action, due to the fact that the bully's father was owner of the company Hyun's dad worked at. They did however talk to the school, and the bully stopped picking on him after that incident. However, Hyun was traumatized from the experience, and came out a different person. Eventually, he fell into suicidal thoughts and developed a history of self harm.!~",

      "description": "Eighteen year old Hyuk Lee is the leader of the Green Roof Apartments Survivors and Eun Lee's older brother. He is also one of the deuteragonists of the series with the others being some of the Green Roof Apartment survivors.\n\nHyuk is an intelligent and level-headed young man with an affinity for leadership. He often plans the many missions the survivors need to undertake. He is unafraid to take risks and is pragmatic, such as accepting an infected human into their ranks, if it helps boost their success rates. He also was prepared to take underhanded measures to tip the odds in his favor. However, as other survivors have learned, Hyuk is extremely blunt in speech and often says things rudely or in a way that would draw their ire. Hyuk is aware of this trait and either uses it to energize people or to provoke people for his own enjoyment. Due to his video game playing habits, he occasionally offers explanations using video game terminology. Because of this and his bluntness, it often embarrasses his sister Eun. Despite this, Hyuk deeply cares about Eun. He notices her actions and is able to deduce that Eun has a crush on Hyun. Hyuk also possesses empathetic traits but masks it greatly for both survival and so that no biases are made when it came to decision making as a leader. However, if there is no harm to the survivors, Hyuk would let emotions and morality guide his decisions.",

He got fired for putting the son of an important person in hospital. \n\nDue to his background, he is more aggressive than others. He still uses physical force to keep others in line, such as Hyun Cha. Despite this, he means well and will selflessly put his life on the line to save others. He appears confident in his ability to live and does not see his acts as a sacrifice, believing he will be able to come back alive. This confidence is borderline reckless: initially, he preferred to fight monsters barehanded, despite their superior strength and unpredictable abilities. He has a strong sense of justice and keeps count of the monsters he killed.",
