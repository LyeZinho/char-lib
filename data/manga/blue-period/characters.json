Yatora feels like his life is dull and predictable, that is, until he comes across his senpai, Maru Mori, painting in the school's art club. He discovers his passion for painting and dedicates his remaining school years to it, aiming to pass the Tokyo University of the Arts entrance exam.\n\nAlthough Yatora is very hardworking and looks composed, there is an underlying insecure part of him that is further exposed when he starts making art. He has an extroverted nature and can easily understand what others are looking for in a relationship, further adapting himself in order to please everyone around him. For that reason, he tends to oppress his own feelings and wishes. Yatora relies a lot on his studied social skills whenever he is under a stressful or unfamiliar situation, but when he is caught by surprise or can't keep up his composed act he has an emotional outburst, often resulting in him crying and speaking more honestly. Yatora is especially hard on himself, putting high standards on himself while constantly undervaluing his own work and comparing himself to others, which ends up overwhelming him. Whilst comparing himself with others, he has great respect and admires the art that others around him create.",

Yuka has a talent for modern street fashion.\n\nThey are closest to their grandmother, who is the reason why they decided to pursue Japanese Art. Yuka will often put on a bright demeanor in front of themselves, and when placed in stressful situations they are often brash and impulsive. Yuka's mother and father both disapprove of their identity and lifestyle. It's shown that they don't have a very happy home life, and can only find solace in the company of their Grandmother, who is accepting of them and their aspirations. It is implied that they often go out at night to get away from home, and that their parents suspect them of trading dates with men for money.\n\nPrefers to be called \"Yuka\", as they choose not to go by the name \"Ayu\" since their idol is singer Ayumi Hamasaki. Yuka is known to often crossdress and test gendered standards of clothing. ~!In chapter 20, Yuka tells Yatora about their bisexuality, explaining how they fell in love with a female middle school friend, but also feels an appeal towards men as well.!~",
