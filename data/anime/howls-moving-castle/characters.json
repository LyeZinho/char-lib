      "description": "Wizard Howl is a mysterious, reclusive wizard. He is twenty-seven years old and known for being very flamboyant and wicked. His notorious moving castle has recently been spotted near Market Chipping and rumours have begun to spread that he is searching for beautiful young women whose hearts he may steal. He comes from Wales, a country unknown to most in the book, where his family still remain unaware of his activities in Sophie&#039;s world or of its existence.    Despite his reputation, Howl is in reality an endearing, charming man who is intelligent and considerate, if somewhat self-appreciative and stubborn at times. He enjoys &quot;slithering out&quot; of uncomfortable situations, often in comical ways.    Howl is described as being tall and suave, fond of dyeing his hair and wearing impressive suits. However, he is described by Calcifer as &quot;very vain for a plain man with mud-coloured hair&quot; - Howl is not naturally handsome, but he has &quot;charm&quot;, both literally and figuratively.",

She has big brown eyes and matching hair, tied with two pink ribbons, in a long braid. She has thick eyebrows, and Howl says that her smile is beautiful. She wears a cerulean dress with a white neck and black buttons. Sophie is a gentle, quiet young woman who doesn't like being in the spotlight. She is mature, and wears clothes meant for women older than her, despite her sister, Lettie's, protests. Sophie also initiates cleaning the massive castle. After getting cursed by the Witch of the Waste, she gains the appearance of a 90-year-old woman (with a similar appearance to Yubaba or Zeniba) with wrinkled skin and pain on her spine. According to her, she becomes more cunning as she has grown older. She still wears her dress, and now wears her straw hat adorned with a red ribbon. Due to her love for Howl, Sophie de-ages depending on her emotional state.",

When Sophie Hatter comes to Howl's moving castle, Calcifer recognizes that she is under a curse thanks to the Witch of Waste and that Sophie has considerable powers of her own of which she is unaware.
