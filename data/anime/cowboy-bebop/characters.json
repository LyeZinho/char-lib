      "description": "One of the members of the bounty hunting crew in the anime series Cowboy Bebop. Although appearing to be no more than her 23 years alive suggests, Faye is actually upwards of 74-years-old, having been put into cryogenic freeze after a space shuttle accident. During the course of the series (set in 2071), Faye manages to cross paths with Spike and Jet twice before she finally makes herself at home aboard their ship the second time, much to the consternation and disapproval of the two men, both of whom have their own reservations about women in general. Faye herself is brash, egotistical, and quite lazy, despite taking plenty of time to pamper and care for her own appearance. Faye has also been placed under arrest several times in the series and spends much time in handcuffs on the ship. She, at times, expects the boys to take care of bounties for her, while she sits by idly to reap the benefits and eat all their food, another source of conflict.  \n\nSeemingly little more than a thorn in her partners’ sides, Faye is actually a well-rounded member of the team. She can handle herself exceptionally well for a woman of her slight appearance, displaying at least once in the series that she packs quite a mean punch. Adept at flying, Faye has stood her ground just as well as Spike has in an aerial dogfight in her ship Red Tail, at times even against Spike in an aerial dogfight. She also excels with guns, and is first seen in the series completely disabling a ship with a Heckler &amp; Koch MP5, though she is immediately apprehended afterward. In the movie, she is seen with the same gun, in addition to her normal companion: a Glock 30. Where Faye really shines, however, is with her mouth. She has an almost unstoppable attitude, and even her sometimes innocent smile can be seen as dangerous. Sarcastic and presumptuous, she rarely appears weak or in need of support. She brags and takes care of herself, never trusting others, cheating and lying her way from one day to the next.",

      "role": "protagonist",
      "description": "Jet, known on his home satellite as the \"Black Dog\" for his tenacity, is a 36-year-old former cop from Ganymede (a Jovian satellite) and acts as Spike's foil during the series. Physically, Jet is very tall with a muscular build. He wears a beard with no mustache, and is completely bald save for the back of his head. Spike acts lazy and uninterested, whereas Jet is hard working and a jack-of-all-trades. Jet was once an investigator in the Inter Solar System Police (ISSP) for many years until he lost his arm in an investigation that went awry when his corrupt partner (and friend at the time) betrayed him. His arm was replaced with a cybernetic limb (later revealed to be by choice, as biological replacements were possible, he wanted the fake arm as a reminder of what happened), yet his loss of limb coupled with the general corruption of the police force prompted Jet to quit the ISSP in disgust and become a freelance bounty hunter. Jet also considers himself something of a renaissance man: he cultivates bonsai trees, cooks, enjoys jazz/blues music (he named his ship the Bebop, referring to a type of jazz), especially Charlie Parker, and even has interest in Goethe. As a character, Jet is the quintessential oyaji or \"dad\" even though he often wishes people would view him as a more brotherly figure (so as not to seem old).  Jet is skilled with handguns, typically carrying a pre-2004 Walther P99, as well as the use of the netgun. He is good with hand to hand combat as well. Unlike Spike, Jet tends to use more raw muscle than technique. He is also a great mechanic and pilot. Aside from the converted interplanetary fishing trawler vessel Bebop, Jet flies a smaller ship called Hammerhead. The Hammerhead appears to be a modified (Jet added larger engines and fuel tanks) salvage-craft that uses a mechanical arm equipped with a harpoon as its main weapon, which is somewhat analogous to his own mechanical arm. Both the Hammerhead and the Bebop are able to land on water, and have a fishing theme, most likely because Ganymede's surface is mostly covered with water (it is later revealed that the Bebop was originally a fishing ship that Jet \"customized\" with larger engines).  ~!During the series, it is revealed that Jet once lived with a woman named Alisa, who left him because he was too controlling. Later they meet up again when Alisa's new boyfriend Rhint is wanted for murder. Jet then ends up in a situation somewhat similar to that of Vicious, where he must hunt down a woman who broke his heart, and her lover.  In a later episode, another Vicious/Spike parallel is set up when Jet finds out that it was his old partner Fad who betrayed him (though in Jet's case, there was no love affair involved). Fad arranged for Jet's death in a setup, but he survived with only a missing arm and a scar on his face. It is worth noting that Jet managed to face the demons of his past and let them go, in contrast to Spike, who was killed when he confronted his. This is likely due to the contrast in the two approaches to the past. While Spike hid and fled from his past, Jet tracked it down and confronted it.!~",

      "description": "Ein is a Pembroke Welsh Corgi brought aboard the Bebop by Spike after a failed attempt to capture a bounty. Ein is a \"data dog\": while the televised series only briefly hints on the fact that this means Ein's brain was somehow enhanced drastically, the manga shows Ed accessing data stored in Ein's brain via a virtual reality-type interface with which she has a conversation with a human proprietor. It is obvious that Ein is abnormally intelligent, as he is able to answer the telephone, drive a car (just the wheel), use the SSW, play shōgi, and generally do a number of other things that an average canine should not be able to do, but he never talks in a human language during the show. He does, however, speak in Session 18 \"Speak Like A Child\" after the credits Ein tells Spike \"Next Episode: Wild Horses\". He is able to \"speak\" to other species, as demonstrated in Session 17, \"Mushroom Samba\" (he spoke to a cow with a subtitled bark of \"Thanks\", to which the cow has a subtitled moo back of \"No problem\"). It is likely that Ed is the only crew member with any idea of Ein's capabilities, as the other crew members are quick to dismiss Ein, and never seem to acknowledge him as more than a pet. Ein initially takes a shine to Jet, but when Ed joins the crew, he comes around to her as well. Frequently the two trade roles, with Ein expressing very human sentiments via facial expression and Ed regressing to a feral state. He went with Ed after she left the crew, probably because of his attachment to her. His name is a pun on the Japanese word for \"dog\" (犬 inu) but is also German for \"one\". \"Ein\" may also be short for \"Einstein\", after Albert Einstein, because of the extraordinary intelligence he possesses.",

He was involved in a plot to kill or injure the former ISSP agent Jet Black, who was one of the few police officers not on the syndicate payroll. As a result Jet lost his arm and was forced to use a prosthetic one. In 2071 Udai was transferred on a transport prison ship to Pluto when an electrically short-circuiting allowed him and his fellow inmates to hijack the ship. Jet and his former partner at the ISSP, Fad, tracked the ship down and boarded it. Fad killed Udai after he revealed that his partner was the shooter that took Jet's arm.  He uses the same knives as Navajas, the knife thrower from Desperados (1995).",

However, she became increasingly unsatisfied, as she felt she had no independence outside of their relationship. One day, she decided she had to end it and left Jet, leaving for him a watch and a note that simply said, \"Farewell.\"\n\nAlisa started to run a bar called La Fin by 2071. However, business became slow as the area was much less trafficked than it used to be. Alisa decided to take out a loan with Law Rentzuo in order to keep the bar open.\n\n(Source: Cowboy Bebop Fandom Wikia)",

      "description": "Giraffe was one of the leaders of the Self-Defense Volunteer Squads. Following a conflict with a group of space raiders, Giraffe was found blindfolded in a silo, presumably betrayed by his partner, Zebra. The Bebop crew later began tracking Giraffe, who was a 3 million Woolong bounty head. Giraffe, meanwhile, is trailing Zebra and Wen, and follows them to a sky rise hotel. After an unseen altercation, Giraffe goes crashing through the window, being caught by Spike Spiegel's Swordfish II.",
