      "description": "A mage from the Fairy Tail guild who wields Celestial Spirit magic.\n\nLucy is cheerful, clever, and often gets swept along by her disruptive guildmates when they go overboard. Empathetic, caring, and more likely to write novels than wage battles, Lucy becomes most emboldened to challenge enemies when she needs to fight for her friends. She is said to be a noisy and somewhat fussy person, and there are times when she can be naive and too easily forgiving, greedy for validation as well as overly confident at inopportune moments. However, despite any failings and instances of self-doubt, she doesn't allow herself to feel down for too long - her optimism is boundless.\n\nIn July of Earth Land year X784, Lucy is a normal 17-year-old Fioran who wishes to join the infamous mage guild, Fairy Tail - although they have a reputation for being thoroughly destructive, she admires their strength and numbers. After a fateful meeting with two members of the guild in the town of Hargeon, Natsu Dragneel and his flying blue cat, Happy, she travels with them back to Fairy Tail, located in Magnolia, to begin the adventure of a lifetime.\n\n~!Lucy's surname is quickly revealed to be quite significant, for it distinguishes her as a member of the Heartfilia family, who head a powerful and wealthy organization called the Heartfilia Konzern. The Heartfilia's connection to Celestial Sprit Magic becomes a key point later on.!~",

With the former, he has had a constant rivalry from a young age and although they often denounce each other as not being friends, they regularly watch each others' back even when they are enraged with one another. He has had the same sort of relationship with Erza - the two both being scared of her since a young age - and they seemed to have a fairly good relationship in the past as, according to Erza, they used to shower together. He befriends people rather quickly too, considering Lucy a friend and willing to team up with her only after a few days of knowing her.\n\nIgneel, a dragon, found him in the forest and ended up taking care of him. He taught Natsu how to speak, read, and use magic. But one day Igneel disappeared without a trace.

He can temporarily grow wings on his back and fly, and is capable of carrying only one person in this form. Happy apparently can fly at incredible speed (As it took Eligor less than a hour to reach Clover when Happy caught up with him in mere seconds with Natsu in tow) This is also the only kind of transportation that does not make Natsu sick. When asked why, Natsu got angry and exclaimed that Happy was a friend, not a means of transportation, ironically Natsu later gets sick when Gray gives him a piggyback ride when he's injured. He's very close to Natsu and becomes friends with Lucy quickly. The three form a team at the start of the manga. Happy is a full-fledged member of Fairy Tail, and has a member stamp on his back. It's also unknown if Happy even though being a mage and a member of Fairy Tail, can use his magic offensively or not.  Happy has a very cheerful nature. Even when facing danger, he maintains a smile. Along with Lucy, he is one of the saner members of Fairy Tail and often acts as the mediator between Natsu and Gray.  Happy's original name was going to be named Freyr, after a Norse god. But Hiro Mashima felt it didn't fit him, so he change the name to Happy to fit the character.   ~!Happy is actually a magical creature that comes from Edolas. These creatures are called Exceed, and are sent to Earthland to kill the Dragon Slayers. When their mission was changed to \"kidnap the Dragon Slayers\", Happy's memory got erased. Later it was revealed that this was not the case but that they were sent there to try to save their lives from a future foreseen by the queen of the Exceed. The \"mission\" was a misunderstanding by Charle who has the same ability as the queen and did not understand what her visions meant.!~",

He is an 18 year-old ice mage, practicing ice alchemy, the art of molding ice. Due to his training history, he is most comfortable in little clothing and often forgets to wear clothes or quickly takes it off, thus often being accused of being an exhibitionist. He and Natsu have a friendly rivalry, and can often be seen fighting one another. Lucy believes the nature of his magic is the reason that he and Natsu constantly bicker. His member stamp is on the right side of his chest.   \n\n~!Gray's adeptness and strength as an ice mage is quickly shown in the story. During the Lullaby of Death arc, he teams with Natsu and Erza to defeat the demon awakened from the evil spirit from the Lullaby of Death. Members of the League praise his quickness at molding ice. Later in the story, he defeats Juvia, one of the Elemental Four of Phantom Lord. This victory may have been partly influenced by Juvia's liking to Gray. Juvia comments on Gray's skill, shocked that he was able to freeze both her boiling water and the rain. After Phantom Lord's defeat, Juvia secretly spies on Gray, bringing a packed lunch for Gray while he and the guild are rebuilding the headquarters.!~  \n\nIn certain panels, Gray's necklaces looks quite similar to the Rave Stone which is a crucial part of another one of Mashima's stories, \"Rave Master.\" Mashima has stated he doesn't remember the name. He takes off his clothes because Ul made him do it as one of her teachings and now it's a force of habit.  \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

He is the grandson of Fairy Tail's master, Makarov Dreyar, and son of Ivan Dreyar.   Laxus is a master of Lightning magic. It allows him to produce, control and manipulate lightning and electricity at his will. Through its use, Laxus can not only generate lightning from his body, but also make it appear from almost anywhere to strike his opponents, taking them by surprise. By generating electricity on different parts of his body, he’s capable of making his attacks in melee deadlier, and of propelling himself around to gain extra momentum. The bright light from his lightning can be also used to momentarily blind enemies. In addition, much like other Elemental types of Magic, Lightning Magic allows Laxus to turn his own body into lightning, in order to evade enemy attacks, move around at high speed and strike every opponent crossing his path.  His eye color is different in the manga and the anime. In the manga, it is orange/dark yellow, while the anime portrays it as greenish blue.",

He attempts to flirt with Lucy but after finding out that she's a Stellar Spirit mage, he quickly stops his advances. Mirajane said that something must have happened to him with a similar female Stellar Spirit mage. She also mentioned that Loke once tried to flirt with Erza, but nearly got himself killed because of it. His weapon is a magical ring and is skilled in \"hand-to-hand\" combat.  He seems to have an interest in Lucy, despite his fear and is the one who searched for Lucy's lost keys and subsequently saves Lucy from bandits.   ~!After his sudden departure from Fairy Tail, Lucy discovers that Loki is a Stellar Spirit, Leo the Lion. His master was the famous Karen Lilica, who was a member of Blue Pegasus. Since her death three years ago, he has remained in the human world, unable to return to the Spirit World because he was exiled for killing his own summoner. He reveals that prolonged stay by a Stellar Spirit in the human world leads to imminent death.  Although he says he killed Karen he did not kill her himself. Karen was abusive, vain, and arrogant towards her other Zodiac Stellar Spirit, the timid and kind Aries. One day she was about to punish Aries by forcing her to remain in the Real World for seven straight days, something that would probably kill her. Sick of Karen's apparently frequent tantrums, Loke summoned himself in Aries' place and refused to go back to the Spirit World until Karen broke both their pacts and left her house. However Karen died on a mission before she could release them. This was due to the fact that she couldn't summon any other spirits while he was already summoned and thus he blamed himself for her death.  However, although Loke had given up hope and was more than willing to die, Lucy managed to convince the Stellar Spirit King to revoke his exile. Loke is now one of Lucy's Stellar Spirits. He promised to be Lucy's backbone, and returned to the spirit world to recover. With him, Lucy now has half the Gold keys.  After recovering, Loke is seen flirting with Lucy and being nice and friendly to everybody. He declared that he has abandoned his old ways, flirting with only Lucy now. He has also self-proclaimed himself to be Lucy's knight in shiny armor.  Before Lucy got annoyed and sent him back to spirit world, he give Lucy's team tickets to a fancy hotel he had planned to take his girlfriends to. Since he can no longer stay long in the real world, he wants Lucy's team to go because he wants to thank them for all the help they've given him.!~  (Source: Wikipedia)",

He hadn't been to the guild for half a year, and hadn't met any of the newer members like Lucy Heartfilia. During Fairy Tail's battle with Phantom Lord Guild, he was off in another town. \n\nHe is part of the Raijinshuu, a group of mages who act as servants to Laxus, with Freed as the self-proclaimed captain. He is known as one of the \"Mystery Men\" along with Mystogan and Gildarts. His magic style is Enchantments. Fried seems to be the most quiet of the Raijinshuu. He also seems to care for his former friends as he questioned Laxus when Laxus told him to kill other Fairy Tail members if he must. He seems to respect Laxus as he does whatever Laxus says even killing other guild members if he is ordered. When Mirajane shouts at him saying weren't they friends, Freed closes his eyes and replied \"we were once\". After Laxus left Fairy Tail, he shaved his head, though it grew back to normal as seen in chapter 165.  \n\nFreed's magic allows him to write runes that, depending on what is written, will actually effect its target, though Freed's magic seems to do more with inflicting pain and suffering on his opponents. It was first used during the Battle of Fairy Tail, where Freed's enchantments were used as traps do have the guild members fight each other to escape. Contrary to Makarov's theory that his magic needed some time to complete, Freed was shown to be able to easily write characters with his sword to produce its effects.  \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

      "description": "Lisanna is the younger sister of both Elfman and Mirajane, and is also a member of Fairy Tail, like her siblings her magic is take over. Her member stamp was on her upper left shoulder and now is on Left Thigh.   ~!It is also very possible that Lisanna, Elfman and Mirajane operated in a three man group similar to Shadow Gear. She lost her life while trying to revert Elfman after his full-body Take Over went awry. He quickly lost control of himself and went on a rampage. Lisana gave her life trying to calm him down and stop his rampage. How she actually was able to do this is unknown. The mental and emotional trauma that Elfman and Mirajane both experienced after Lisana's death crippled their powers considerably. Mirajane lost her S-class rank and has not fought since. Elfman suffered major emotional damage and was incapable to cast his full body takeover spell for some time. When he did try casting it, a flashback to Lisana caused him to lose concentration. When Lisanna was younger, she seemed to be very kind like Elfman and unlike Mirajane. She wanted to help Natsu Dragneel raise an unknown egg to see what comes out of it, being a little more knowledgeable in it then Natsu. After seeing a softer side of the usually flamboyant Natsu, she stated that he was a lot like her sister and joked that perhaps later she should become his bride which predictably freaked him out. It is shown that while the Earth Land version of Lisanna is deceased, the Edoras version of Lisanna is still alive. Like her Earth land counterpart, she seems just as friendly and caring, as seen when she scolds Lucy for bullying Natsu and tells Jet and Droy not to pick on Elfman. When Natsu and Happy see her they both shed tears and tried to hug her in joy, this freaked her out. She doesn't seem to have the massive crush her Earth Realm counterpart has on Natsu.!~   ~!In chapter 199, it is told that the Earth Realm Lisanna was sucked into Edoras and didn't die. After she was taken back to the Earthland by the reverse anima. She was found by PantherLily and taken to Natsu and the others. There she explained everything to them and go back to the Fairy Tail Guild!~",

In the past, Karen the Celestial Spirit mage forced her to do many horrible things and generally abused her, such as using her as a shield (Because, apparently, she has no fighting abilities) and using her to lead away all of her boyfriends instead of simply refusing them.   ~!Loke arc  Three years prior to the story, Aries was owned by Karen Lilica. In Loke's flashback, Aries was treated horribly by Karen. She used her to keep her \"boyfriends\" away from her. She tries to protest but she is too intimidated by Karen. Blue Pegasus Guildmaster Bob sees this and warns Karen to take care of her spirits. In a rage, she accuses Aries of ratting her out and apparently physically assaults her, although all that is seen is Aries getting shoved to the floor.  Karen threatens to keep Aries in the human world for a week, but before Karen can act on this threat, Loke steps in by summoning himself to take Aries' place (Since Karen could only maintain one spirit at a time) and tells the Celestial Spirit Mage to break her contracts with Aries and himself. When she refuses, Leo threatens to remain in the human world until she agrees, rendering Karen unable to summon any other Celestial Spirits. Karen continues to refuse, since she believes that he cannot remain in the human world for a long time; however, Leo leaves her with the ultimatum and goes to a deserted chapel where he stays for three months, attempting to get Karen to break the contracts. When Leo returns, he learns that Karen was killed on a mission and that Aries' key was taken.  Oracion Seis arc  After an exchange in the Spirit World, Aries is summoned to battle with Loke and Lucy Heartfilia. Despite the two not wanting to fight one other, they choose to fight for the sake of their pride, and the battle begins. However, due to Aries' non-combative nature, she fights a losing battle to Loke. As the battle progresses, Angel summons Caelum and uses it to blast through Aries and hit Loke, causing them both to return to the Celestial World for healing. After her defeat, Angel is arrested and her contracts with her spirits are broken. Aries, along with Scorpio and Gemini, seek out Lucy and form contracts with her instead.  Edoras arc  Lucy summons Aries to prevent the Edoras soldiers from capturing her and her friends. Aries then proceeds to attack the soldiers with a technique called \"Wool Bomb\", which allows Lucy and company to escape.!~",

      "description": "The legendary dark mage Zeref is a human wizard known to history as the strongest and most evil mage to ever walk the earth. He lived over 400 years ago, but even to the present day his legacy continues in the form of other dark wizards and dark guilds who worship Zerefs power. In fact most dark guilds were founded and operate under the pretense of reviving Zeref, and helping him to conquer the world. Not only was he an incredibly strong mage, but he was also regarded as a genius, and he used his immense intellect to try to research and discover new magic, regardless of his status as the most powerful human alive. He is also responsible for the creation of tens of thousands of demons by means of his living magic, and these demons continue to roam the earth, leaving trails of destruction behind them. Aside from living magic, Zeref was also a skilled user of death magic.~!At an unspecified point in time, Zeref created the Alvarez empire, which is an empire comprised of all 730 magic guilds of Alakitasia that Zeref brought together by means of martial force. There he is known as Emperor Spriggan. He is regarded by his citizens as a great and kind ruler, but also a fearsome and powerful one. He created an elite group of the most powerful mages in the empire, and they bear the name the Spriggan 12.!~~!400 years ago, Zeref's parents and little brother were killed by dragons. He then proceeded to study magic at Mildian Magic Academy where he studied the connections between life, death, and magic in the hopes of resurrecting his lost brother. He continued to study this and created the R-System and Eclipse Gate against the wishes of his superiors, who feared the wrath of Ankhseram (the god of life and death). At the time, he was a very caring and smart boy, but then Ankhseram cursed Zeref with the curse of contradiction (the more he values human life, the more the people around him will die), as well as immortality. Since then he has searched the earth and created countless demons, even the Etherious so that he may somehow die, however he has been unsuccessful. The time Zeref has spend under the curse of contradiction has slowly begun to take its toll on Zerefs mind, and he has begun to develop symptoms of a split personality, one personality being his original kind self, but the other being a mage who believes humans no longer deserve to live (as they have repeated the same mistakes of useless fighting and wars over and over throughout the many years he’s been alive).!~~!Over his many years, Zeref had encountered Fairy Tails first master Mavis on multiple occasions. They took a liking to each other, with Mavis denying Zerefs claim that he was a monster exactly like the legends of him say. Mavis was eventually placed under the very same curse as him, and she grew into an unstable mind set. Zeref attempted to comfort her when she told him of this, and they decided to live together to search for a way to end the curse. They had fallen in love, but as they shared their first kiss, the curse of contradiction took effect, with Zerefs curse becoming the dominant of the 2 and consequently, Mavis is killed. Zeref was emotionally scarred by the death of the woman he loved, and he embarked on his seemingly endless journey to find death once again.!~~!Zeref eventually found a way to revive his younger brother, Natsu, and in doing so, also created a demon with the potential to kill him like he wanted. The new demon was named E.N.D, Etherious Natsu Dragneel (Natsu being Zeref's younger brother, and Zeref's surname being Dragneel).!~",

However, he can be serious when he wants to be, to the point that he can initiate a battle by openly declaring that he will end the lives of his opponents.    When calm and out of the battlefield, Hughes is easy-going and playful, and even then, he sometimes play with his adversaries from time to time. His love for the amusement granted by the dying Magic in Edolas motivates him to resort to any means to obtain more of it, even at the cost of Earthland Mages, revealing a heartless and sadistic side.    He also appears to have zero perversive tendencies, showing absolute indifference to a bikini-clad Lucy after Natsu convinced her to take part in her \"sexy strategy\".     is first seen with the rest of the Royal Captains, and telling Erza how amazing the converted Earthland Lacrima is. He is then seen taunting the imprisoned Natsu and Wendy, telling them that the exceed (Happy and Charle) have been returned to their homeland, and that Lucy is probably set to be executed. After that, he attends a meeting with Faust, Coco, Byro, Sugarboy, and Patherlily, leaving when dismissed. He is seen staring at Lucy, Charle, and Happy after they have escaped, along with the rest of the Royal Captains from the ground.    Hughes later reappears with Sugarboy at an amusement park inside the castle. He attacks Natsu, Gray, and Lucy with what appears to be a rocking Viking ship. He then comments on how the magic from Edolas is going to disappear really soon, and how he won&#039;t let anyone get in his way of obtaining more magic. He manages to get Natsu on one of the roller coasters which he explains can accelerate at a velocity that can de-stabilize anyone on-board after a few minutes. Only to realize that Natsu has already been disabled, much to his own surprise and amusement. Later Lucy is thrown up too and the two land in the park's water. Hughes then reveals he controls everything in the park including the water and attacks Natsu and Lucy with it. The water washes Natsu and Lucy to the Monster Academy, and Hughes finds (after some difficulty) them there. Lucy uses a \"sexy strategy\" against Hughes in an attempt to bring his guard down, but it fails and he sends his monsters after her. He then uses his monsters, such as the mummy and the Frankenstein's monster, to battle against Natsu by wrapping its linen around the Dragon Slayer, only for Natsu to engulf himself in flames, incinerating the mummy's bondage, shocking Hughes yet again. But not enough to deter him as he sends more monster minions against Natsu, diverting their attention away from Lucy (who then was able to make a clean escape); for a moment, their sheer numbers appear to have allowed them the upper hand. However, the monsters are scared off by Natsu, who somehow summons a dragon. Hughes shows utmost shock at Natsu&#039;s move. Later, Hughes was punched against a wall by Natsu, crashing into Byro (whose head was against it on the other side) in the process. Both he and Byro have been defeated. At the very end, when Anima is sucking out the magic and the Earth Land mages and Exceed, he is seen with Sugarboy and Byro.!~",

Her counterpart's surname, \"Scarlet\" was replaced with \"Knightwalker\".    ~!Unlike her Earth Land counterpart, Edolas Erza is sadistic, cruel, and would kill with a smile. Showing no sympathies towards her enemies and kills without mercy, she had been involved in killing over half of the members of Edolas Fairy Tail, thus earning the title Erza the Fairy Hunter. She seems to take great pride of this title bestowed upon her; as a result, she took it as a personal insult when Lucy told Knightwalker that her Earthland counterpart happens to be a staunch ally of the Earthland Fairy Tail Guild whose loyalty to her friends was also unquestionable. This led to her becoming more hostile than she already was towards Lucy, she even opted to kill her by dropping her from a great height.   Knightwalker also appears to value her pride as a Captain for the Royal Army; and Charle making her prostrate herself by kneeling down to the floor seemed to be a real blow to her ego that when Pantherlily informed her of Happy and Charle's rebel status (and that was made even worse by the fact that Charle wheedled information from her only mere moments ago regarding the location of Natsu and Wendy through trickery by claiming to be the daughter of Shagote), the latter became the first whom she targeted to kill. However her streak of fighting has made her overly arrogant and she doesn't seem to take losing lightly as seen when Erza Scarlet managed to temporarily beat her off screen. !~",

Some time later, in the Year X736, Precht appointed Makarov (40 years old at that time) as the third Master and his successor, much to the man's dismay. Ignoring Makarov's claims that he wasn't fit for it, he praised Makarov's love for his allies and his capability to believe, claiming that he would have made Fairy Tail into a good Guild. He then left on a journey. On such journey, he traced the roots of Magic back to Zeref, where he saw what can be called the \"Essence of Magic.\" It is presumably around this point that he reformed his ways and became a Dark Mage, and then founded Grimoire Heart.!~\n\n~!He was later killed by Zeref.!~",

He also wears a white cape with the Edolas insignia on it. When seen without a shirt, Sugarboy has a very muscular upper body.  Sugarboy can be seen as very goofy, not only in appearance, but also in personality. He can suddenly drastically change his facial expressions, as seen when fighting Gray Fullbuster. Sugarboy can notably do some strange things, without even knowing how he did it himself, such as gliding in battle. Sugarboy can be seen as over-dramatic in situations as well, such as when he saw Gray make a duplicate key. Sugarboy can be serious though around meeting with his fellow captains, and has very respectable opinions.  [Source: Fairy Tail Wiki]",

Just as he is about to kill Makarov, all of Fairy Tail comes back and starts attacking the dragon.

Mary Hughes wears a dark green full-body suit, which is sleeveless. Under the top of this suit she has a white collared shirt, through which she ties a red ribbon. Around her waist sits a brown utility belt. Her hands are covered with long gloves that end just before her elbow and her feet are covered by large brown boots.  Mary Hughes has a slightly malicious and cruel personality, laughing at the Fairy Tail guild when she saw the pain they were in when they couldn't win against her. She seems to have a liking of controlling people, manipulating them with her Magic and enjoying the fact that she can make them attack their own friends.  She doesn't like people commenting on her appearance, seen when she stated to instantly dislike Natsu when he commented on the fact that she was a woman. When Kinana threw rocks at her, Mary Hughes claimed she was angry enough to commit murder, hinting that she does not like being made to look weak.  When asked by Lucy why she would allow her and Michelle to fall over a cliff, Mary Hughes nonchalantly states that if they fall, they will be injured enough that they won't be able to escape her, showing a total lack of caring for others that she considers her enemy or target.

From her chest downwards, the dress becomes detailed and colourful, being divided into many sections, with the chest area and skirt being yellow, and the part that covers Earth Land Coco's stomach red. On her feet, Earth Land Coco wears a pair of bright red sandals.  Earth Land Coco does not have the kind, wouldn't-hurt-a-fly personality that her Edolas counterpart possess. In fact, she is much the opposite, attacking her enemies with ferocity and precision. She seems to take great pride in her abilities, and after performing a particularly difficult stunt of some description, she will openly shout the performance scores she believes her opponent has granted her, with them always being 8/10 or above.  Despite her harder personality, Earth Land Coco still seems quite naive, seen when Lucy and Michelle managed to fool and confuse her by playing a tricky word game and pretending that the other girl was Lucy. After the said game, Lucy said that she felt guilty fooling around with the girl, with Michelle commenting that she is still \"so innocent\".  In contrast to her Edolas counterpart, Earth Land Coco has stated that she hates cats.  (Source: Fairy Tail Wikia)",

He carries his two weapons, Ricochet and Habaraki, with him at all times.   __Personality:__ Dan is a very eager, cheerful and somewhat energetic person, often sporting a wide grin on his face.

Rabian has been shown to write outrageous plays with ridiculous plot twists like in \"Frederick and Yanderica\" where confusion after confusion ensued. This garnered him bad reviews for his plays and eventually the actors that performed for him left him. He seems, at first, quite emotional when he imparted his miserable story to Team Natsu. Later, he is shown to have a tendency to take things to excess, as seen when he made Team Natsu perform the same play three times a day for a week while withholding their pay. It is also ironic how Rabian often says \"Thank you very much!\" after almost every sentence but treats his cast quite ungratefully, even commenting that Team Natsu, the cast who earned him tons of audience for a week, is composed of amateurs.   ~!During the Grand Magic Games of X791, Rabian is seen guest judging during the fourth day's events, saying that it's very fun to be there.!~ (Source: Fairy Tail Wiki)",
