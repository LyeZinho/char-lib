She convinces him to sign a contract, involving him in her \"big project\", with the goal of making him an average person. Though seeing right through his actions, she tries reading him (beginner's) psychology books in an attempt to click with his feelings and \"save\" him.\n\n~!Her backstory varies depending on the media. In the anime, it is revealed later on that the only reason she is helping Satou is to save herself from being worthless. Due to traumatic childhood experiences such as living with her abusive stepfather and seeing her mother committing suicide, she believes that she isn't worth anything and her existence is a reason for people's misfortune. She feels useless and the only way she can live with it is to have someone to rely on her.\n\nHowever, in the manga and light novel, it is revealed she made those details up in an effort to manipulate and try to help Satou through unconventional means. Her story in the media mentioned above actually involves both her parents being happy, healthy, kind, and wealthy.\n\nHer biological father gave her the name \"Misaki\" (岬) which means \"promontory\" in Japanese after the Ishihama Promontory.!~",
