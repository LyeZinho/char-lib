When they were children, Armin showed him a book depicting the wonders of the outside world. Eren grew to share Armin's curiosity of the world beyond the Walls and resolved to see it for himself. This dream inspired his admiration of the Survey Corps and his desire to join their ranks as soon as he became eligible for enrollment. \n\nWhen the Titans suddenly broke through Wall Maria into Shiganshina, Eren was forced to watch on as his mother became trapped under the rubble of their house and eaten by a titan. Forever changed from this event, Eren vows to kill every last titan.",

Eren discovered this and helped her escape her captors. Later, Eren gave her his scarf, which she constantly wears and shares an emotional attachment to. She was adopted by the Yaeger family soon after. Because of these past events, Mikasa shares an unbreakable bond with Eren and lives to protect him, constantly worrying for Eren's well-being. After the Titans broke through Wall Maria and killed her and Eren's mother, she chose to follow Eren into the military to try and keep him safe from danger. \n\nEven as a child, Mikasa possessed impressive fighting skill and strength, and that skill was only honed further during her training.  Mikasa is considered a genius among all the army trainees and is incredibly skilled at combat and agility, to the point that she was known as the greatest soldier among the 104th Training Corps and graduated in first place. Though being among the best of the best, she remains humble and refrains from displaying arrogance. Ultimately, Mikasa's loyalty remains with Eren no matter the circumstance, with her only true desire being to live a peaceful life with him.",

After Wall Maria was breached, he chose to join Mikasa and Eren in joining the military, both to try to make a good and meaningful impact on the world, and to fulfill his dream of seeing the outside world.\n\nEven when he was young, the naturally curious Armin has always had a deep fascination with the world beyond the Walls. As a child, he found and studied an illegal book about the outside world that was owned by his grandfather. He often shared the book and information contained in it with Eren Yeager, his best friend, and his dreams of seeing the world outside the walls. Armin was branded a heretic by other children for his unusual interest in the outside world and was thus frequently picked on. Too timid to defend himself, Armin would often rely on his friends Eren and Mikasa Ackerman to protect him from local bullies. This, coupled with his frail physique, was a deep shame for Armin, leading him to have poor self-esteem and to believe that he is a burden to others. Because of this, Armin has always been very eager to prove his worth, especially towards his close friends. \n\nArmin is known to be exceptionally loyal and selfless. He constantly worries for the safety of his friends, and he is always prepared to throw himself into dangerous situations to save them. Alongside his kindhearted nature and emotionally intelligence, Armin is a very analytical person. He likes to think deeply about situations and solve problems using his mind. These personality traits, in conjunction with his intelligence, good judgment, level headedness, ability to plan ahead, come up with creative ideas and to think outside the box, are what make him a great tactician. Although he may appear among the physically weakest of the 104th Training Corps, his incredible intelligence and strategic genius makes him an invaluable asset to any team.",

When the 145th Fritz King built the walls and decided to move to the island Paradis, her branch of the Fritz family stayed behind due to disagreements with the King's choice. She joined the Eldia Restorationists on Marley, in order to revive the pride and power of Eldia. In this group, she also met Grisha Yeager, whom she eventually married. She gave birth to their son, Zeke Yeager. At the age of 7, there son reported his parents to the Marley government. As a result, all the Eldia Restorationists were sent to Utopia. Sergeant Major Gross injected Dina with the Titan serum and she was thrown off the Borderline wall to Utopia, as Grisha, in horror, watched his wife turn into a Titan.!~\n\n~!After the Colossus Titan breaches Shiganshina District in Wall Maria, many Titans proceed inside and among them is Dina. She embarks inside the town and is seen by Eren and Mikasa as they try to free Carla Yeager, who is trapped under the debris of their house. Though Hannes initially comes to their aid and decides to face Dina, he stands catatonic in fear of her frightening appearance. After he realizes that he is too afraid to face it, he opts to instead take Eren and Mikasa to safety, leaving Eren's mother behind. Afterwards, Eren witnesses Dina pull Carla out of the debris, as it proceeds to violently incapacitate her and devour her shortly thereafter.!~\n\n~!Five years later, after Eren had already joined the Survey Corps, Dina appears again before Eren and Mikasa outside the Titan Forest during the military's pursuit of the Armored Titan. After killing Hannes, who was protecting Eren and Mikasa before he was devoured, the Titan reaches out for Eren, who punches its hand. This activates powers Eren was previously unaware of, and seemingly gains control over the surrounding Titans. The ones that are under his control proceed to kill Dina by ripping her to shreds and devouring her, avenging the deaths of Carla and Hannes.!~",

Decades prior, however, Kenny was known as an infamous serial killer that stalked victims in the capitol. \n\nDespite his dark field of work, Kenny appears to be rather jovial and takes pleasure in taunting his adversaries during battle. When fighting, he becomes animated and lively, often making a scene or otherwise throwing insults and witticisms. However, he also fought with control and was able to effortlessly sneak up on his targets when they least expected him. His preferred method of killing during his time as a serial killer was to slit the throats of his victims which earned him his infamous handle \"Kenny the Ripper\", and it was rumored that he murdered over 100 members of the Military Police Brigade. However, decades later his killings ceased and the terror that he once inspired dwindled into an Urban Legend. He eventually was found working under the Royal Government, the reasoning for his sudden shift in behavior being a mystery. Kenny is ultimately, despite his comical personality, very cold and calculated, sparing little emotional attachment or loyalty to anyone, with only a few exceptions.\n\n~!ㅤ\nHe notably shares the same bloodline as both [Levi](https://anilist.co/character/45627/Levi) and [Mikasa Ackerman](https://anilist.co/character/40881/Mikasa-Ackerman).!~",
