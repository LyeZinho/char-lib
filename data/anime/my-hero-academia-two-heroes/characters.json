Izuku has since become All Might's closest pupil.\n\nIzuku is a very timid, reserved, and polite boy. Although initially portrayed as insecure, tearful, and vulnerable, Izuku gradually matures into a more confident and braver person. His infectious leadership skills, combined with his passion and strategic abilities, have turned Izuku into a central figure of Class 1-A. He is caring and emotional, never hesitating to help or rescue someone in danger, even if he knows that he might not be strong or otherwise qualified enough to do it.\n\nIzuku is extremely (and sometimes scarily) enthusiastic about topics related to heroes. His dream drives him to write down notes about everything he learns about heroes' Quirks and fighting capabilities. Thanks to this practice, Izuku has developed a great analytical mind and can form complex battle plans in a few seconds, factoring in the best ways he can utilize the Quirks of allies and enemies alike for his own advantage.\n\nIzuku's Quirk \"One For All\" was transferred to him from All Might. His Quirk allows him to stockpile an enormous amount of raw power, allowing him to significantly enhance all of his physical abilities to various boundless levels. This results in unbelievable levels of strength, speed, stamina, agility, and durability. Izuku can focus the stockpiled power into a single body part, or spread it across his entire body evenly, though, focusing the power in a single part puts a greater strain on that part of his body.",

Due to the constant praise of his abilities and powerful Quirk, Katsuki has developed a superiority complex, and because of that, he desires to be the first and best at everything. He loves to win above all else and cannot stand it when he doesn't, leading him to lose his already short temper if he achieves anything but a complete victory.\n\nKatsuki is not only very athletic and talented at fighting, but also very intelligent and extremely perceptive, capable of strategic planning and improvisation. Additionally, his grades are among the highest of his class. Katsuki also possesses surprising talent in other areas, such as cooking and music, even though he doesn't show a particular interest in them. Overall, Katsuki is considered a natural-born genius with the potential to be one of the best Pro Heroes.\n\nKatsuki's Quirk \"Explosion\" allows him to secrete nitroglycerin-like sweat from the palms of his hands and ignite it on command, allowing him to create strong explosions. The more Katsuki sweats, the stronger his explosions become. Not only can Katsuki use the explosions for attacking, he can also use them to propel himself and navigate through the air at high speeds, allowing him to fly at his opponents without giving them time to react, as well as evade incoming attacks, even while in the air. The shockwave from an explosion can even be used as a shield.",

He is the youngest son of the top hero Endeavor.\n\nShouto initially has a cold, aloof personality, which stemmed from his complicated family life. Focused and unemotional, Shouto preferred to keep things to himself instead of hanging out with others. After the events of the U.A. Sports Festival, however, he notably became more sociable and kinder than ever before. He even gained a sense of humor and would occasionally smile, although still retaining some fragments of his previous distant attitude and nonchalant demeanor. While usually quiet and reserved, Shouto initially possessed a moderate level of arrogance, which, combined with his solitary tendencies, sometimes made him take the initiative without considering the opinions of others.\n\nShouto's Quirk Half-Cold Half-Hot gives him the ability to generate ice from the right side of his body, and flames from his left side. Due to years of rejecting his father, Shouto has developed a habit of favoring ice, even when fire would be a better option. This grudge also caused him to have difficulty controlling his flames.
