She initially appears very serious and cold-hearted, but she is actually caring and worries about the safety of her comrades. She has a younger sister named Kurome, who is a member of the Jaegers, and loyal to the Empire. Her Teigu is the One-Cut Killer: Murasame, a katana known for being coated in an immensely deadly poison that could kill those cut by it within seconds, as the poison itself has no antidote.\n\n ~!When she was a child, her parents had sold both her and Kurome to the Empire. There, they were placed and raised as Assassins from childhood. Akame in particular became infamous enough to earned the top rank in the Imperial Assassin Division. At some point, many of her comrades had died and she become dissatisfied and resentful towards the government. It was not until she was sent to kill former General Najenda that Akame finally defected to the Rebels after being swayed by her.!~",

The incident in the theater implies he solely enjoys causing carnage.\n\nAlso much like Cosmina, Champ, and Enshin, Shura took part in the mass rape during the Umatora Theater incident where the producer denies the accusation of it's plays criticizing the Empire and tries to bribe Shura, but he declines the money in a heartbeat declaring the death sentence on them leading to the entire team being raped and killed by Wild Hunt in which Shura shows his twisted side by calling this action an investigation. He then mentions that this is all because Esdeath was not present in the Capital.\n\nAfter his devilish act, Shura joyfully tells his father how much of a kick he gets from leading Wild Hunt telling he made preparations to take out Night Raid. Along with his father, he watches the Great General Budo arrive.\n\n~!In Chapter 52, he tortures what he thinks is an unarmed Lubbock; however, Lubbock manages to trick Shura into removing his shackles. He then pulls some string out of his mouth and immediately kills Shura.\n!~",
