      "description": "__Height:__ 145 cm\n\nTaiga is a girl in Ryuuji's class. She has a well-regulated and beautiful appearance though is unable to stomach company from others. Due to her often snapping at others in brutal ways and her short stature, she is given the nickname \"Palmtop Tiger\". Her under-developed body and the added nickname has given her a complex which in turn serves to give her a negative attitude and facial expression. Essentially, Taiga gets upset easily and is considerably clumsy. She is also brutally honest, typically when she is lashing out at someone. Due to her cute looks (described as a doll by Ryuuji), she often gets confessions of love by boys, but she turns down every one of them, including Yūsaku Kitamura (which she later regrets).\n\nDespite coming from a well-to-do family, her life with them is very difficult because of various problems. Her father's business went bankrupt and he ran away, leaving Taiga in the care of her mother who was already remarried and had a new family of her own. Taiga has difficulty getting along with her step-father and half-sibling and since then, she has taken to living on her own. Since she came from a privileged household, she does not know how to do any domestic chores. When she meets Ryuuji and learns of his domestic talents, she ends up relying on Ryuuji to clean up after her. Aside from sleeping in her own house, and going to school, she spends most of her time at Ryuuji's house; so much so that she is considered a member of his family. At the beginning of the story, she is infatuated with his best friend Yūsaku Kitamura and gets nervous every time he appears around her. Due to this, Taiga and Ryuuji team up to help each other get into a relationship with each other's best friend.  \n\n~!Though she treats Ryuuji badly at first, her feelings begin to change as she spends more time with him. They later become a couple.!~",

Due to biological inheritance, his sanpaku eyes make him look like an intimidating delinquent and causes many misunderstandings. He lives in a fatherless family with just his mother, and due to this, Ryūji has learned to be self-sufficient. He is good at cooking and keeps everything in his house clean (to the point of obsession), and also excels at sewing. He holds a crush on Minori Kushieda, a girl in his class. He has a pet, parakeet named \"Inko-chan\" (\"inko\" literally means \"parakeet\" in Japanese). Ryūji often helps Taiga with domestic chores which she is unable to perform. At school, he is known as \"the only person able to stop the palmtop tiger\", referring to Taiga's nickname. Due to the misunderstandings of his look, he tends to look down on himself and lacks self-confidence. Despite this, he is rather calm in most situations. He is responsible, smart and has great grades, even when compared to Yūsaku Kitamura, his best friend. He is dense when it comes to girls' feelings, especially about things between him, Taiga, Minori and Ami. His feelings and relationship to Taiga begin to change as he spends more time with her throughout the series.",

      "description": "__Height:__ 165 cm\n\nAmi is Yuusaku's childhood friend who transfers into his class midway through their second year of high school. She is very beautiful and even works as a model, though after she transfers school, she temporarily stops modeling. However, she still continues to go to the gym readily and maintains a slim figure. She is always kind and generous towards others, though this is merely a deception. In truth, she is arrogant and will not hesitate to use others for her own benefit. During her first meeting with Taiga, Ami showed her true colors, but the tables were turned when Taiga threw a counterattack back at her. Since then, Ami and Taiga have been enemies, though Ami still sometimes envies Taiga since she can always be honest. It's hinted at, mostly through her childhood friend Yuusaku, that she's like this because she hasn't really known any other life than her modeling, which is part of the reason she moved to their hometown to attend school there.  Which is why, through her affiliations with Taiga and Ryuuji, Ami eventually develops more of a \"middle ground\" personality, signified with her losing her temper and taking out her frustrations on a stalker fan. While this doesn't mean that she automatically becomes friends with Taiga, the two of them also meet halfway to some extent, thus running into arguments far less frequently. She can still be somewhat manipulative and mischievous, but her \"gravure airhead\" personality is almost entirely abandoned for a more outspoken one, and she's even helped out her newfound friends, including Taiga, on occasion. At some point, she even showed some interest in Ryuuji. \n\n~!Ami is also the first one to realize that Taiga and Ryuuji have feelings for each other, and is constantly hinting Ryuuji to pursue Taiga.!~",
