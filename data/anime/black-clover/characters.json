She is constantly shown to appear as a rather stern woman, despite inwardly having an inward monologue that constantly appears to say calm down, especially around Yami Sukehiro. She often does not respond to situations that go out of hand, preferring to appear indifferent and let things play out. She does respond well to emergencies and pressing concerns, performing her duties and moving swiftly to take care of any problems that come up. However, she still is capable of losing her composure and becoming annoyed, which almost always involves Yami teasing of her. She is also a lightweight when it comes to alcohol, barely able to finish a pint before becoming drunk.\n\nCharlotte considers her duty to the kingdom to be her foremost responsibility, with little interest in the social aspects of life. Her beauty is quite noticeable when she chooses to show it, but she is more comfortable in plate mail than silk dresses and cares little for the opinions of most others. She also has a hard time being open with most people and expressing herself on occasion. That said, she often quips back at her fellow captains when they make rash decisions or do something she considers stupid, particularly Yami. However, she also has admiration for those who are competent and work hard, though she rarely ever shows it. Outwardly, she displays little interest in finding a husband and becomes angry when the subject is brought up, for which Yami repeatedly teases her and calls her \"Spiny Prickly Queen.\"",

He assumes the identity of Xerx Lugner during the Royal Knights Selection Exam. Zora changes during the Selection Exam where he begins to take on a similar mindset to his father, with a strong trust in his comrades. The current Wizard King confronts Zora after the exam, speaking of how he was a friend of his fathers having met on the battlefield. The Wizard King prompts Zora to join the Magic Knight Squad he belongs in (presumably the Black Bulls), however Zora shrugs this off, ignoring the Wizard King. !~",
