      "description": "__Height:__ 175 cm (5'9\")\n\nSaitama is the main protagonist of One Punch Man, and the most powerful hero alive. Having apparently trained himself to superhuman condition, Saitama faces an existential crisis as he is now too powerful to gain any thrill from his heroic deeds.  He is registered with the Heroes Association as a B-Class Superhero and is tasked to defend Z-City against Mysterious Beings. \n\nFor a superhero, Saitama is rather laid-back. Because even the mightiest foes pose no challenge to him, he doesn't take his hero work very seriously. In spite of this, he is constantly searching for an opponent that can challenge him, since his superhero work is beginning to bore him because it's too easy. The combination of his attitude, unstoppable strength, and distinctively simple and 'unimpressive' appearance often cause his battles to become anticlimactic. Saitama will usually allow his opponents to rant about their motives and power up into their strongest forms before suddenly and nonchalantly obliterating them with one punch.",

He is considered to be very handsome by the public. Aside from being a hero he is also a famous model, actor and singer, being the most popular one in the world. Sweet Mask has stated that he believes that heroes are to protect the citizens, and if they can't do that, they must become strong enough to be able to do so. He also genuinely cares for the well-being of the citizens around him and actually wishes happiness upon every living thing in the universe. However, befitting the darker side of Sweet Mask's name is his hidden merciless nature. He is shown to have a burning hatred for anything that he sees as evil. Anything that he declares as evil must be swiftly and thoroughly exterminated. \n\nSweet Mask is shown to adhere to any method that makes heroes popular. He notes that only promotions to S-Class or A-Class are fit for his attention, as they are the heroes who draw the most attention from the public, and hence, any heroes in those ranks who earn themselves negative reputations would drag his reputation down as well. Because of this, Sweet Mask stays in the A-Class Rank 1 position to prevent unworthy heroes from promoting to S-Class. \n\nSweet Mask is very narcissistic about \"beauty overwhelming the power\", as he said about his philosophy that \"heroes have to be beautiful as well\". This became obvious when he showed interest in a worthy S-Class Hero like Genos, who has both a beautiful appeal and having done more heroic deeds as the main priority, fitting Sweet Mask's philosophy. \n\n~! However, after witnessing the defeat of Garou by Saitama, his viewpoint changes and becomes more focused on the overwhelming power of the individual than beauty alone. !~",

He wears a turtleneck sweater, has sunken cheeks, a defined jawline and a squarish chin. Notably, a loud drumming sound may be heard in his proximity. The King Engine is a rumbling sound that others claim occurs when King readies for battle or when he is generally serious having an intimidating effect on his opponents. ~! In actuality, it is simply the sound of King's heartbeat which, when he is frightened, is so loud that it can be heard outside his body, but because of King's intimidating reputation people mistake it for bloodlust. King is able to appear to remain calm in threatening situations as well as put out an extremely threatening aura. Despite the intimidating personality King projects, he is actually a coward and an otaku. He has been shown to get very excited about buying a dating game. Saitama saved his life many times, but always end up getting all the credits that was supposed to be for the latter. With this misunderstanding, he came to be known as \"the strongest man on earth\".

      "description": "__Race:__ Human-Mutant\n__Abilities:__ Regeneration\n__S-Class:__ Rank 8\n__Affiliation:__ Hero Association\n\n__Personality:__ Zombieman is stated to be nihilistic, possibly due to the fact that he has \"died\" several times, therefore he is always calm. In addition, he prefers to work as a lone wolf and dislikes gathering, although he still respects common courtesy. However, he appears to have a sadistic side, since he enjoys killings that create rivers of blood, he is also shown to be a rather smart individual, with detective-like thinking. In comparison to the other S-Class heroes, Zombieman is more thoughtful and respectful.\n\n__Abilities__: Zombieman possesses one of the best regeneration capabilities in the series. He is able to regenerate any part of his body no matter how severe the injury is, and he was able to heal his broken arms in an instant. He needs only a few minutes to recover from an extremely mutilated state and regrow his left arm, however this regeneration does not give Zombieman full immortality, as he will die if he is reduced to mincemeat. Zombieman has an incredible threshold for extensive physical activity, displaying one of the most impressive feats of stamina in the series and being able to fight for hours on end while his expedient recovery rate handles the more serious of injuries he suffers.",
