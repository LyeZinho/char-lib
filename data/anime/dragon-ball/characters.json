      "description": "__Race:__ ~!Saiyan!~\n__Height:__ 175 cm (5'9\")\n__Birth Year:__ 737 Age  \n__Hobby:__ Fighting a Strong Opponent\n\nSon Gokuu is a boy we meet in a forest far from any civilization. He lives in this forest alone as his grandpa passed away, he only has this special orb-like object called a Dragon Ball to remember him by, which he will sometimes talk to as if it is his Grandpa Gohan. As the series continues, Gokuu meets Bulma, a brilliant teenage girl, and they go on a journey to collect these 7 magical dragon balls which actually have wish granting powers once all of them are collected. During this journey they meet and befriend Yamcha, Oolong, and Pu'ar, whose characters mirror those found in Wu Cheng'en's _Journey to the West_. Gokuu also encounters one his closest friends, Kuririn, and others during his time training. Participating in several World Martials Arts Tournaments, ~!Gokuu also battles foes-turned-allies such as Tien Shinhan and Chiaotzu, as well as the offspring of Demon King Piccolo named Piccolo Junior.!~\n\n~!\n_Dragon Ball Z_ takes place 5 years after the defeat of King Piccolo and Gokuu's last world tournament. We come to find out that Son Gokuu was originally named Kakarot, and is born a member of a race of extraterrestrials called the Saiyans. Shortly following his birth, Gokuu was sent from his home, planet Vegeta, to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life but due to that injury to his head that caused him severe amnesia, Gokuu forgot his purpose, and instead started focusing on becoming stronger for a little more than the pleasure of it. He now has a son named Son Gohan (named after Grandpa Gohan) who is some what of a cry baby but has hidden potential. Throughout the series, Gokuu faces terribly strong opponents like other powerful Saiyans, Intergalactic Rulers, Androids, and Extraterrestrial Beings that give him fights like no other. Along with new enemies, Gokuu also gains new friends that help him in these situations.  \n\nIn  _Dragon Ball GT_, which was not based on Toriyama's manga, Gokuu is turned into a child by a wish on the dragon balls by Pilaf. The series revolves around him traveling around space to find the Black Star Dragon Balls with the help of his granddaughter, Pan, and Trunks. The series ends with Gokuu leaving for good with Shenron and returning one hundred years later to witness the match between Gokuu Jr. and Vegeta Jr.  \n\nIn  _Dragon Ball Online_ (which takes place 216 years after Dragon Ball Z, and unlike Dragon Ball GT, Toriyama had a lot of creative control over the story), a new villain by the name of Miira appears with the goal to obtain Gokuu's DNA.  In  _Cross Epoch_, the  _Dragon Ball_ and  _One Piece_ crossover one-shot, Gokuu is seen accompanying Luffy to attend a party hosted by Shenron from whom key characters from both series had received an invitation.!~\n\n(Source: Dragon Ball Super Exciting Character Guide)",

Bulma is a direct parody of the character Xuanzang from the Chinese novel Journey to the West. Even though Bulma's character parodies a monk, her Japanese name \"Buruma\" is the brand of a popular gym short worn by girls in Japan. Her re-adapted name Bulma is a direct take on the word \"bloomers\", which was a popular brand of women's underwear in the early 20th century.  Bulma is the second character to be introduced in the Dragon Ball series. In the early part of the story, she is the inventor of the Dragon Radar and is searching for the legendary Dragon Balls. Bulma was hoping to use the Dragon Balls to wish for the perfect boyfriend. While searching for a nearby Dragon Ball, she runs into Son Goku. It is at this time that she finds out Goku inherited one of the balls (the four-star ball) she is searching for from his Grandpa Gohan. Because of Goku's love for the ball and his belief that his Grandpa's spirit lives in the ball, Goku is not willing to give it up. Bulma then asks him to loan it for her in exchange of taking him in her travels. At that point, they team up to find the remainder of the balls and the adventure begins. In the later action-oriented episodes of the series, there is little room for a genius but Bulma continues to play a role as a secondary character, helping Goku and his friends with her gadgets, and having a rather rocky relationship with Yamcha.",

      "description": "Pu'ar is a soft-spoken shapechanging blue creature and the constant companion of Yamcha. The name is revealed to be a pun on Pu-erh tea. Pu'ar is neither a cat or a mouse, albeit the series creator Akira Toriyama stated that he had drawn the character to look a little bit like a cat. Traveling alongside Yamcha, the two worked as a team robbing anyone traveling through the desert area in which they lived. Pu'ar has an innate ability of levitation or flight, and is nearly always seen simply 'standing' in thin air at about human head height.  Pu'ar has the unique ability to shapeshift into any form, even inanimate objects, and can hold that form for as long as desired; his strength is not increased by the change, however, and as such he is unable to turn into something that can be used up like fuel or food. Pu'ar graduated from the same shapeshifting academy as Oolong, although unlike Oolong, Pu'ar had completed all of the academy training and does not have Oolong's difficulties with maintaining a transformed state. Pu'ar shows up quite a bit in the beginning, but becomes less of a presence as the series continues. As the driving theme of the series is mostly about fighting, Pu'ar can do little more than react to the horrors of the latest supervillains in the story.  There is some debate regarding the character's gender. Despite being portrayed by several female voice actors, the character has been referred to with both male and female pronouns during the anime. Though the issue of gender is never directly addressed, Toriyama has referred to Pu'ar as \"he\" while answering a fan question in the \"Ask Me Anything\" section in the back of the manga. Some fans believe that since shape-shifters can assume many different forms, gender is a moot point.",

He was somewhat demonic and frightening when his castle became engulfed in flames on Frypan Mountain.  He wreaked havoc through the village at the foot of the mountain, threatening anyone he presumed would steal his treasure, until Kamesen'nin showed him the error of his ways. He is Chichi's father and thus Son Goku's father-in-law. Gyuumaouis very strong and trained alongside Grandpa Son Gohan under Muten-Rôshi's tutelage.   As the series progresses, Gyuumaou's role lessens in the story and eventually fades into being a background character, used only for slight comic relief. Gyuumaouis also the grandfather of Gohan and Goten. In anime filler, he has a few large roles though from time to time, mainly accompanying his family and the others.  \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

He is muscular, tall, and a man of few words.      ~!Shortly after befriending Son Goku, he fends off Captain Yellow&#039;s men by himself, but he is later speared by Tao Pai Pai, who is looking for Goku, and killed. Goku avenges him by taking training from Karin and defeating Tao Pai Pai himself. When Shenlong is summoned again, Goku&#039;s wish is that Bora be brought back to life. In his next appearance, he assists Goku once more by throwing Yajirobe (with an injured Goku on his back) up Karin Tower. Bora is seen with his son (and several other natives) in the first and last couple episodes of Dragon Ball Z when the Z Warriors go to Kami&#039;s Lookout for training against the Saiyans and when he gives energy to Goku for his Genki Dama. He also briefly appears in the GT episode &quot;Piccolo&#039;s Decision&quot; when Goku is with Upa. Bora&#039;s appearance and customs are based upon the stereotypical Native American.!~",

She is often depicted as a sometimes nagging, overprotective but fundamentally well-meaning woman, who sincerely looks for her children and husband's well-being even when their views clash. She and Goku meet as children, and Goku promises to marry her thinking marriage is food. Several years later, she finds him at the 23rd Tenkaichi Budoukai, and despite confessing that he misunderstood what she had meant, he fulfills his promise and asks her to marry him. As she gets older, she disapproves of Goku's lifestyle, enough to ban Gohan from following in his foot steps, but due to the threats like Vegeta and Freeza, she is forced to let him train under Piccolo and Goku. She relaxes this with Goten by training him herself while Gohan is away for school. She has a wild temper and can react in violent anger over the slightest annoyance which means all of the Z Warriors fear her and try to avoid making her mad.

He is easy-going and friendly.
