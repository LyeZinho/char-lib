He is the youngest State Alchemist ever to be recognized by the Amestris State Military, having received the title at the age of 12. Ed's primary motivation throughout the series is to return his younger brother, Alphonse, to his original body, which was lost in a failed human transmutation. Edward, despite his occasional bouts of immaturity, is a selfless boy who gains a reputation as a \"hero of the people\" throughout his youth. Notably, he doesn't seem concerned about returning his own arm and leg, instead focusing entirely on Al's suffering.\n\nEdward is small for his age, standing at only 149 cm (4'11\"), however his body is that of an experienced martial artist, with noticeable muscles and a wealth of agility. Although he lacks both his right arm and left leg, Ed's ability to fight is not impaired, and is in fact improved, as he will often use alchemy to cause his metal arm to partly transform into a blade or shield. His heavy automail limbs are considered by him to be the very best in Amestris. They were made by his childhood friend, Winry Rockbell, and she is constantly working on them. He is able to think quickly, even in desperate situations, though can still be frightened into paralysis. These qualities, combined with his alchemical powers and physical strength, make him a formidable fighter.",

She expands their training with a regimen of philosophy, martial arts, and living off the land. Her methods are derived from her own alchemy training: in the manga and second anime, she was forced to survive in the northern region surrounding Briggs Fortress for a month (although it turns out she succeeded by stealing supplies from the northern fortress), whereas in the first anime she was taught by Dante. She thinks of the Elrics as her own sons, and although she severs her student-teacher ties with them after learning of their attempts with human transmutation (and similarly Ed's joining the State Military), she continues to do all she can to help them. She can be quite violent when punishing or sparring with the Elric brothers, so they tend to be deathly afraid of her. Her claim of \"I'm a housewife!\" while confronting Greed was a favorite scene of Arakawa's to draw.  Izumi and her husband Sig Curtis (シグ・カーティス, Shigu Kātisu) were expecting a child years before the start of the series; however, their son was stillborn. Izumi tried and failed to revive the child through human transmutation (an act that created Wrath in the first anime). The failed attempt took some of her internal organs, resulting in infertility, and causing her to periodically cough up blood. Izumi gained the ability to use alchemy without a transmutation circle after seeing the \"truth.\"  In the manga, Izumi attracts the attention of the State Military for surviving the failed human transmutation. As she and her husband travel around Amestris in order to avoid the military, they eventually meet Ed and Al's father Hohenheim. He rearranges her insides to ease the blood flow, and persuades her to help collaborate in bringing down the State Military.",

      "description": "Roy Mustang is a state alchemist and officer in the Amestrian state military. A hero of the Ishval Civil War and [Edward Elric](https://anilist.co/character/11/Edward-Elric)’s superior officer, Mustang is a remarkably capable commander who plans to become the next Führer of Amestris.\n\nMustang is a clean-shaven young man with dark eyes. His dark hair is casually unkempt, falling over his eyes; in more formal or somber situations, however, he is known to wear it neatly slicked back. A great fan of classy attire, Mustang is rarely seen out of uniform (and even while in uniform will often don other accouterments, such as a long, black overcoat and white formal-wear gloves), but when dressed in civilian clothes, he appears rather partial to the three-piece suit and black tie (frequently coupled with classic scarves, polished dress shoes, and the aforementioned overcoat and gloves). He tends toward dark or neutral colors in his dress, such as dark blue, brown, and black tempered with minimal white.\n\n~!After the events of his fight with [Lust](https://anilist.co/character/650/Lust), Mustang carries a faint scar on the back of his right hand in the shape of the flame alchemy transmutation circle. He also carries a large burn wound on his left side, lower back, and abdomen from the same event.!~\n\nOn the surface, Mustang is presented as a shallow, self-absorbed, and incorrigible womanizer who is infamous among many of his colleagues and subordinates alike for the selfish and narcissistic aura he gives off. Easily as arrogant as Edward Elric, Mustang is one to act ostentatiously and appears to act mostly out of self-interest rather than any sort of philanthropy. He comes off to most as a sort of cocky layabout, shirking most of his duties and delegating his paperwork to subordinates while sitting idly at his desk with an amused smile on his face as he procrastinates, but is quick to take action when it appears that there is glory and military notoriety to be gained. Mustang is expertly manipulative and prone to think several steps ahead of those around him, giving him a remarkable talent for making subordinates act exactly as he wishes despite appearing not to have had a hand in their decisions - all traits which make the fact that he has managed to attain the lofty rank of colonel at such a young age a matter of public gossip.\n\nMustang also has a reputation of being a shameless flirt, and it's rumored that he spends much of his time cavorting about town with various women and wooing several of the servicewomen with his abundant charm, good looks, and charisma. This adds another facet to his unpopularity among the enlisted men, many of whom fear having sweethearts and crushes romanced away from them by his hand. He has, however, never actually been shown to be on a serious date with any woman; any flirtatious interactions he had with women seemed to be nothing more than a cover to discretely pass along information.\n\nAt the core, Mustang is a remarkably devoted commander whose primary focus and personal duty is to his friends and subordinates. Though he hides it well behind a veil of cynicism and self-importance, Mustang is a man who cares deeply about the people who trust and support him and goes to great lengths to ensure their safety and well-being, even at the risk of his own. As a man with considerable power, Mustang considers himself a protector to those without and acts accordingly, earning the staunch loyalty of his most trusted compatriots.\n\nOrphaned at a young age, Mustang was adopted by his father's younger sister, who brought him up intending to make him into a fine gentleman. Presumably, in his teens, he discovered an affinity for alchemy and took basic instruction in the craft from master alchemist [Berthold Hawkeye](https://anilist.co/character/75922/Berthold-Hawkeye) in the hopes of becoming a source of strength and knowledge for the people of Amestris. However, faced with the increasing frequency of border wars, he left his teacher's charge and enrolled in the state military academy with the intent of becoming a state alchemist and devoting himself to the protection of citizens caught in the crossfire of international struggles. While at the military academy, he became friends with fellow cadet [Maes Hughes](https://anilist.co/character/69/Maes-Hughes), with whom he often discussed his idealistic dreams for the future of the country.\n\n~![Pride](https://anilist.co/character/10982/Selim-Bradley) uses the Gold-Toothed Doctor to open the Gate of Truth, forcing Mustang into it. What happens while Mustang is at the gate is unclear, but as he leaves, he is transported to the room where Edward Elric, [Alphonse Elric](https://anilist.co/character/12/Alphonse-Elric), and [Izumi Curtis](https://anilist.co/character/67/Izumi-Curtis) were taken before. Elric tries to talk to him, and Mustang replies that he cannot see; [Truth](https://anilist.co/character/33816/Truth) has taken his sight as the price of looking inside the gate, either to \"deprive the man who had a grand vision to save his country from his eyesight, denying him to see what his beloved nation will become\". as Homunculus claims it to be, or merely to give a price for seeing the Truth.\n\nMustang's blindness is later cured with a Philosopher's Stone at the end of the series. In [Brotherhood](https://anilist.co/anime/5114/Fullmetal-Alchemist-Brotherhood/), the stone is used to heal Havoc's paralysis before curing his blindness.!~\n\n(Source: Fullmetal Alchemist Wiki, edited)",

He is able to rearrange the carbon in his body to make his skin as hard as diamond, thus making himself almost impossible to injure. As his name implies he is a very avaricious character, who likes living in luxury, surrounded by powerful minions and beautiful women. Despite his generally greedy nature, he’s shown to honestly care for his subordinates. He also has a habit of flipping people off in the manga.    \n\n __In the 2003 anime series:__  Greed is the second oldest of the Homunculi created by Dante. However, due to his avarice, Greed rebelled and was eventually captured and imprisoned in lab 5. He was imprisoned for 130 years until an explosion broke his seal. He then freed the caged chimera at Lab 5 in exchange for helping him get his revenge on the other homunculi and their master.    \n\n __In the manga and 2009 anime series:__  He is the third Homunculus created by Father. Greed apparently abandoned the other Homunculi over 100 years before the start of the series and claims to be around two centuries old. He first appears hiding in the Devil&#039;s Nest in Dublith, with his gang of chimeras all of whom he apparently rescued from military experimentation.      ~!After Greed is punished by Father, he later returns as Father removes his son&#039;s Philosopher&#039;s Stone core from his own body and inserts it directly into the body of Ling Yao to create a second Human-based Homunculus. This second Greed maintains all the same personality and powers as the first (his Ouroboros tattoo is even in the same spot), but appears to have none of his previous memories, not recognizing Envy, Gluttony, or the Elric Brothers. As such, he becomes a faithful servant of his Father, as the first Greed was presumed to have been initially, and refers to all actions prior to his rebirth as having been done by &quot;the other Greed&quot;.    After killing a past comrade and follower of his, memories from Greed&#039;s previous life returned, including his time in the Devil&#039;s Nest and the feelings he had for his followers. Remembering this, along with how Bradley killed most of his followers, leads Greed to betray Father once again. He also stops referring to his &quot;previous self&quot; as &quot;the other Greed&quot; upon regaining his memories.  !~ (Source: Wikia)",

Lust is also usually partnered with Gluttony to whom she appears to have a particular almost motherly closeness. Her Ouroboros mark is located on her collarbone, just above her breasts.     \n\n __In the 2003 anime series;__  She is largely the same as her manga counterpart, highly intelligent, manipulative, devoted to her own ideals, however she begins to crave becoming a human as the series progresses. Her main purpose amongst the Homunculi is gathering information and traveling abroad, manipulating alchemists into creating Philosopher&#039;s Stones. Gaining true humanity is the focal point of her ambition, arguably much more so than the rest of the Homunculi.     \n\n~!Lust was created by Scar&#039;s brother, when he attempted to use alchemy to bring his lover back from the dead. After he was cast out from Ishbalan society as a heretic, Envy visited the wretched creature and fed it red stones, giving her human shape, and her new name. She was not the first Homunculus to bear the name of Lust, and is the third youngest Homunculus.!~\n\n __In the manga and 2009 anime series;__  Lust is the only female Homunculus and the second to be created by Father. Due to her high intelligence and devotion to Father&#039;s plan, Lust appears to have a great deal of free reign and authority within the organization, seeming to have a position second only to Pride and on par with Wrath. Lust also has a great disdain for humans, thinking them frail, predictable and generally stupid. Moreover, she appears to take pleasure in using and throwing them away. Lust is the first to introduce the idea of Homunculi as superhuman, the next wave of evolution of humanity, and takes pride in her nature.    -Taken in part from Wikia.",

They use this power to assume the form of any person and even copy their voice. They usually serve as a spy, but their abilities are also extremely useful for assassinations. Envy may not be as smart as some of the other homunculi, but they are by no means an idiot. In fact, they can be just as good a puppet master as Lust, but this is overshadowed by their cockiness and bad temper. This temper can easily be set off by insulting their large and delicate ego, causing them to make mistakes.  \n\n__In the 2003 anime series:__ As the oldest Homunculus, Envy claimed that they had forgotten what they originally looked like. Envy also greatly hates all humans and followed Dante mostly for the opportunity of killing as many people as they could. This is what drove Envy in all that they did and unlike other Homunculi, Envy does not care about the Philosopher's Stone, nor about becoming human. ~!Towards the very end of the series it is revealed that Envy was created four hundred years ago by Hohenheim in an attempt to resurrect the son he and Dante had, who later died from mercury poisoning when he was eighteen years old. Envy held a great hatred toward Hohenheim for never being acknowledged as his son and for abandoning them and Dante.!~  \n\n__In the manga and 2009 anime series:__ Envy was the fourth Homunculus created by Father. Though often referred to as a 'he' Envy is apparently genderless and can take almost any form it chooses. Referred to by Lust as the most cruel or sadistic of the Homunculi, Envy shows the most open disdain of humans and relishes in any opportunity to hurt, humiliate, or insult them. They are also quite vain and short tempered and dislikes anyone insulting their appearance. ~!Beneath this cruel exterior, however, Envy is secretly envious of humans' inner strength and the mutually beneficial friendships that they share, since most of the Homunculi show little real concern or emotional support for each other.!~  \n\n(Source: Fullmetal Alchemist Wikia)",

She became targeted as Dante's next vessel with the new Philosopher's Stone. Dante hypnotized Rosé, and her baby was used by Dante to open the Gate. While she's kept with Dante in the underground city, Edward finds her dancing alone in the ballroom under the trance. While the two of them are dancing, Rose tells Edward that she had been waiting for him. She then tells Ed that she loves him. Edward blushes and pushes her away, asking if she knows what she's saying and that they're \"just friends\". It is unclear if Rose said it under Dante's \"hypnosis\" or genuinely loves him. (In the Japanese dialogue, Rosé doesn't tell Ed that she loves him. Although, it is somewhat implied she might say it and Edward pushes her away and asks if Al was brought there.)  Edward's death breaks her trance. At the end of the anime, Rosé and her child appear to have moved to Risembool, living happily with Winry and Pinako.!~  __In the 2009 anime:__   ~!Taking Ed's words to heart, she helps to rebuild the town, eventually reuniting with Alphonse Elric. She makes a comment on how she is depressed that Ed is not with them, admitting that she has really missed him and that she wishes to see him again. This causes Winry to become slightly jealous, something Al catches and taunts her with.  She later comments to Winry how she is thankful toward Ed for opening her eyes to the false belief and got the town moving on their accord.!~ (Source: Wikipedia)",

Kimblee's powers appear to be much the same as those in the Anime, except that he can transmute and detonate from a distance as well, using the ground as a connecting force, causing huge explosions (though probably it is because his force is imbued with Philosopher's Stone).",

He left Ed, Al, and their mother Trisha when Al was a baby and Ed was very young. Years later, Ed still holds a grudge against him for abandoning his mother, which he believes contributed to her death.    (Source: Wikipedia)  In the Fullmetal Alchemist manga he is refered to as \"Van Hohenheim,\" not Hohenheim Elric. As Edward Elric points out in book 14 of the Fullmetal Alchemist manga, \"Elric is my mother's name!\" He (in the original 2003 anime)...  ~!  Has been alive for centuries. He worked in a lab, which took advantage of 'witch trials' as human bait, to create the first philosopher's stone. He succeeded, but it cost him his life. Dante, (his lover at the moment) attached his soul (much like Al to armor) to the nearest man in the room, reviving Hohenheim. They continued this practice for many years, until Hohenheim fell in love and married Trisha Elric. After they sired Edward and Alphonse, he left for fear Dante would use them against him, and also because he felt ashamed of his past. Like Dante, his flesh is wearing away, so he must wear cologne to mask the scent. He can transmute without circles, because when he died, he saw past the gate, as did Dante. !~  He (in the manga and 2009 series) is...  ~! a human Philosopher's Stone. Homunculus (Father) was a test subject at a lab in which Hohenheim worked (in fact, Father was the one who named Hohenheim). The king of Xerxes demanded the secret of immortality from the homunculus, and he obliged. a country wide transmutation is formed, and everything is working as planned. However, at the last minute, Father lies about where the center of the circle is, and engulfs both himself and Hohenheim into the gate. Hohenheim wakes to see everybody in his country dead. He meets Homunculus, who tells him everything, how he has now gained half of the powers of the stone. Homunculus did this out of gratitude. after these events, Hohenheim travels to Xing, and founds the art of Alkahestry.!~",

He was fused with a lizard or a gecko; this enabled him to have a firm grip on surfaces when climbing, and to use his tail as a bludgeoning weapon. He is bald and speaks in a raspy, hacksaw voice, though it's unclear whether this is a result of the fusion or not.   ~!In The first anime he is killed by the military. In \"Brotherhood\" he survives instead of Martel. He searches for Greed and finds him in Father's lair. Unfortunately, the homunculus has forgotten about Bido and kill him. Afterwords, Greed's old memories start to return and Greed realizes he has killed the last member of his family with his own hands.!~",

Upon learning of his student&#039;s &quot;crusade&quot; against State Alchemists, he counsels him on the teachings of Ishvala. In the anime, he says, &quot;Even in the darkest of suffering, a man can sleep. But for the man who inflicts the suffering, his mind cannot rest. Ever.&quot; In the manga, he explains &quot;Revenge only grows seeds of revenge,&quot; (which Scar didn&#039;t care for much until he found Winry pointing a gun at him, intending to seek revenge for her parents&#039; deaths, as Scar was their killer in the manga). He later speaks on behalf of the Ishvalans at a refugee camp when Mustang and his men arrive looking for Scar. Scar&#039;s master was one of the few survivors of the covert op of which Martel was a part, and which triggered the Ishval massacre. He is never mentioned by name in the anime. He does exist in the Manga because he can be seen in a cameo in Chapter 58 for a brief period of time, and in chapter 72 in flashback when he stating that although they may (and should) not forgive the damage Amestris done to the Ishval, but they must not surrender to the hatred, and endure it, to sever the bonds of hatred, since they&#039;re human beings.",

She takes Ed, Al and Winry to see Dominic at Winry&#039;s wish. Paninya had made a living out of pickpocketing tourists in Rush Valley, but after a talk with Winry she realizes that being a criminal would defeat the purpose that Dominic intended for her when he gave her free legs. She is currently working legitimate odd jobs around Garfiel&#039;s shop.    In the anime she also has an automail arm, which gets damaged in an arm wrestling contest. It also appears that Dominic adopted her after she lost her limbs in a train crash. No mention was made of what she did for a living, though in the chase with Edward, she was taking his pocketwatch to a pawn shop.However,this was most likely winry&#039;s idea for Ed cheating in an automail contest.Since she is seen in Dominics shop it can be assumed that she might work for him.    She was seen at the end of the anime, helping Winry perfect her skills.    In the manga the only automail she possesses is her prosthetic legs. It is noted that one leg has a Carbine rifle built into it by Dominic and the other a blade. She pickpocketed from tourists to try to pay back Dominic, who lives out in the mountains of Rush Valley with his son, his wife, and herself, for her automail. Dominic always refuses to accept her stolen money. After reforming her ways, she becomes a roofer and Dominic begins to reluctantly accept her money.",

It appears as a pure white, nearly formless being almost indistinguishable from the rest of the endless white expanse which surrounds the Gate but for a shadowy outline which causes Truth to reflect the shape of the person it is talking to, thereby supporting its claim to be another shade of that very person. When Edward and Alphonse Elric each appeared before the Gate, Truth took on the shape of a young boy and when Izumi Curtis appeared, Truth&#039;s shape reflected that of a young woman, appeared as a vigorous man to Roy Mustang, and a white version of Father&#039;s flask form.    Truth initially introduces itself as the being some people call God, the World or the Universe, at first seeming welcoming and jovial to its guests before calling attention to their hubris and opening the Gate, which forces them inside. At this point, Truth often smiles with an eerily wide and insane grin that is similar to that of the Homunculus Gluttony and Father.   When the alchemist in question returns from his or her sojourn through the Gate, Truth informs them of the necessary toll for accessing the Universe&#039;s knowledge and collects it, usually in the form of a body part which disintegrates off the alchemist and reappears on Truth&#039;s form. In this way Truth is responsible for the taking of Edward&#039;s left leg and right arm, some of Izumi&#039;s internal organs, Roy&#039;s eyesight, and Alphonse&#039;s entire body.   It would appear that Truth&#039;s goal is to discourage humans from treading in God&#039;s domain, as it calls Edward a fool when the young boy returns and sacrifices his arm to recover his brother&#039;s soul.

At first it appears to Mustang that Raven can be trusted (the General&#039;s jovial nature and complimentary speech putting the nervous Colonel at ease) but when Mustang tests the waters by mentioning a rumor about the F&uuml;hrer being a Homunculus, Raven leads Roy into the Central Command room and repeats the rumor for all (including Bradley himself) to hear, revealing that ALL of Central Command is already entrenched in the malevolent machinations taking place in Amestris at Father&#039;s behest. !~",

      "description": "Master Berthold Hawkeye was both the alchemist who mentored Roy Mustang as well as the estranged father of Riza Hawkeye.  A brilliant alchemist, Hawkeye postulated the complex and intricate theorems necessary to apply flame alchemy at its most powerful and efficient level, but refused to pass on his flame alchemy secrets to his pupil, thinking them too dangerous for young and naive Roy. Riza describes her father as a frightening man with whom she did not generally associate and could not at all relate. Afraid of his life's work being destroyed and what his Flame Alchemy knowledge could do if it fell into the wrong hands, Master Hawkeye refrained from keeping notes in the normal fashion and, instead, tattooed a large Transmutation Array containing the culmination of his craft and findings on his daughter's back, perhaps further straining - or serving as an indication of - the Hawkeyes' already shaky relationship.  Master Hawkeye, as an independent alchemist, appears to hold some disdain for the State Military (much like Izumi Curtis), as revealed by his flippant reaction to Roy's enlistment during the Ishval Civil War as well as his preference of living in squalor with all his genius over joining the State Alchemist Program.  As Roy returned to his teacher's house in an attempt to get hold of the theory of Flame Alchemy to enlist as a State Alchemist (he was just a regular soldier at that time), Master Hawkeye revealed to him his daughter possessed the theory and succumbed to illness, coughing up blood as he died in Roy's arms.
