      "description": "Yoshida is the main male character of the Hige wo Soru. Soshite Joshikousei wo Hirou. series. He is an office worker in Tokyo who lives alone in his apartment. One night, after being rejected by his boss, Airi Gotou, he had a fateful encounter with a runaway high school girl named Sayu.\n\nLiving alone most of his life, Yoshida grew to be a highly independent person. He is an exceptional and reliable employee who's always dedicated to his work; pulling off overtime daily and even helps lighten the load of tasks of his colleagues. He is a man of virtue. Even though he barely knew Sayu he was more than willing to let her stay at his place and felt a sense of responsibility of guiding and watching over her. He is very kind towards others which baffles almost anyone who knew him. He is also a huge gentleman. Unlike most other men, he resists firmly to temptation as seen when Sayu was initially very seductive of him and asked him to make love with her. He believes that he should only do that with a woman whom he loves and that his feelings are also being reciprocated.\n\nBecause of his upright and serious nature, Yoshida is not good at dealing with women especially those who can control the flow of conversation. He only had one girlfriend throughout his life and it was a high school senpai. Yoshida openly admitted that his type is mature, older woman.",

      "description": "Sayu Ogiwara is the main female character of the Hige wo Soru. Soshite Joshikousei wo Hirou. She is a runaway high school girl from Hokkaido who ended up in Tokyo, in which she had a fateful encounter with a stranger named Yoshida.\n\nAfter running away from her hometown and family for unclear reasons, Sayu was forced to adapt and live her new life as a runaway high school girl. With no money to sustain her basic needs like food and shelter, she gathered her resolve and resorted into seducing men, using her body as a bargaining chip in order to survive. As she kept this lifestyle for about half a year, she became shrewd and adopted a playful, flirty mask to hide her pain and used her bright smile for deceit. To mask her identity, she used aliases. She also developed a high level of maturity and strong mental fortitude, traits which are uncommon for a normal high school girl to have at her age.She hated what she was doing at first, but after a while, being wanted by those men made her feel she could be herself and that she was needed. For her, it was simple and she liked it that way. Because she was already used to that kind of arrangement, she was conflicted when Yoshida let her stay without any significant demands.\n\n~!Sayu is a daughter of the Ogiwara Family, a prominent family hailing from the city of Asahikawa, Hokkaido. Her older brother, Issa Ogiwara, is a CEO of a famous food corporation.!~\n\n~!Sayu has romantic feelings for Yoshida but decided to suppress it in order not to get in the way of Yoshida's lovelife and put a strain to their relationship.!~",
