Reishi is a sophisticated, observant and composed individual who is cautious in the battlefield. Though he is willing to use physical action in a fight, Reishi does attempt to win with victory through negotiation instead. He is a natural leader and generally puts the concern of innocent lives over his own. Though he possesses a general loathing towards Mikoto Suoh, Reishi still accepts him as a human being. He takes immediate notice when his vice-commander Awashima's displays apparent disregard for his civil rights. However, he remained indifferent to how the idea could effect the Red King, even stating that it was a good one. Reishi has a fondness for solving jigsaw puzzles during his spare time.  As a member of SCEPTER4, Reishi has power over lightning, imbibing himself in a blue color. When exerted, the aura has the defensive potential to protect Reishi and his subordinates against a direct attack from the flames of Mikoto Suoh, known as the king of HOMRA and an incredibly powerful combatant.
