His current appearance is far different from his junior high days thanks to following the suggestion of [Fumiya Kurimoto](https://anilist.co/character/135349/Fumiya-Kurimoto) (Natsuo's best friend), who forced him to wear contact lenses instead of eye glasses and have his curly hair flattened daily.",

      "description": "__Sign:__ Aries\n__Height:__ 1.65 m (5'4\")\n__Occupation:__ Teacher\n\nHina Tachibana, is one of the main female protagonists of the series. She is the elder sister of [Rui Tachibana](https://anilist.co/character/127596/Rui-Tachibana), but soon after [Tsukiko Tachibana](https://anilist.co/character/135347/Tsukiko-Tachibana) (Hina's divorced mother) marries a widower named [Akihito Fujii](https://anilist.co/character/135352/Akihito-Fujii), Hina becomes the stepsister of [Natsuo Fujii](https://anilist.co/character/127594/Natsuo-Fujii).\n\n_Appearance:_ Hina is a young woman with waist-length dark brown hair that has trimmed bangs which are parted above her right eye, emerald eyes, she is described to be well endowed with a voluptuous figure where men unable to take their eyes off of her when she's in swimwear and her natural beauty combined with her friendly personality has made her an outcast in high school due to the jealousy of female classmates back in her high school years. Nowadays, she is in her early twenties, but she is used to dressing up formally wearing a suit, a blouse and a knee-length skirt with medium-height heels. But at home she wears tops and shorts, and when she goes out, she wears nice dresses. So even though she is endowed with a nice feminine body, it is not perceived at simple sight.\n\n_Personality:_ Hina is a gentle and pure-hearted young woman whose cheerful attitude mixed with her naiveness gives her an aura of tenderness impossible to go unnoticed, even though she is a little bit clumsy and helpless at cooking. That actually caused her some distress back in her second year of high school, when her female friends out of jealousy decided to shun her. That was the time back then when she met a third year Biology teacher named [Shuu Hagiwara](https://anilist.co/character/135346/Shuu-Hagiwara), who after noticing she was crying while eating left alone in the science lab, used a hand puppet and a trick on ventriloquy to take her out of her sadness. It turned out that she became a regular there, until the teacher left the school by the end of that year. That experience might have pushed her into pursuing the career of teaching.\n~! It is also pretty much likely that due to a necessity of a paternal figure added to the kindness of [Shuu](https://anilist.co/character/135346/Shuu-Hagiwara), she developed a crush on him, which led her to get involved into an affair with him time after they ran into each other as she was in her fourth year at the university. !~\nIt is not so clear if she feels becoming a teacher is her true call, even though she admits she has worked really hard to get her license. She is really into comedy shows. She does enjoy festivals in general, not only for the food but for the different attractions, especially the goldfish scooping. She is afraid of cockroaches to the point of running away from seeing them, without worrying if she is wearing something or not. She also freezes up with thunder storms.",

Her standoffish personality has made it difficult for her to socialize. As her first meeting at a mixer, she didn't do much to interact with the others. Once someone passes through her cold demeanor, Rui is actually a very kind and loving girl throughout the series. In spite of this, it can be hard for her to express her feelings towards someone she genuinely likes. She is very supportive of people she cares about, in spite of their flaws and even if their desires conflict with her own. Rui has a tendency to pout when things don't go her way, though [Natsuo](https://anilist.co/character/127594/Natsuo-Fujii) finds this feature of hers adorable. Rui is also surprisingly easy to embarrass in spite of her stoic personality. When [Natsuo](https://anilist.co/character/127594/Natsuo-Fujii) lists all of her behaviors he finds cute, especially to other people in front of her, she becomes overwhelmingly flustered.",

Her parents have a very bad relationship and they are almost always working, which leaves Momo by herself for nearly whole days on end.\n~! As a result of this and her poor relationships with her peers, she once began self-harming.

He's an openly gay man and prefers to be addressed as Marie, though he is often addressed as The Master or Mari-san by others. His coworkers are [Fumiya Kurimoto](https://anilist.co/character/135349/Fumiya-Kurimoto) and Ayano. Kobayashi tends to aid [Natsuo](https://anilist.co/character/127594/Natsuo-Fujii) and others by providing advice and consultation.\n\n_Appearance:_ Kobayashi is a strong and athletic individual, keeping himself in shape with various exercise, including yoga. He has long, curly black hair that is often tied in a ponytail, and sports a light trimmed mustache. He is very high maintenance, keeping his body hairless and well moisturized, and wears expensive cologne. Kobayashi has a typical Yakuza style tattoo that covers his back and parts of his chest. Although he can look quite intimidating when wearing his old Yakuza outfits, he often prefers to wear something more effeminate and/or revealing. His typical work attire includes a usual waiter's button shirt and bowtie, but he happens to wear very short trousers with leggings. He is also not opposed to dressing in drag, wearing a fundoshi, or even a leather thong.\n\n_Personality:_ Kobayashi is a bright, cheerful, and flamboyant person. He often speaks in an effeminate form of speech. Because of this, he can speak on the same level with the females of the series, and can even be quite snarky with them. Kobayashi insists that people call him Marie or Mari-san, and gets irked when people address him by his actual name. Kobayashi is an empathetic person, sensing when others are emotionally disturbed and offers whatever advice he can - though sometimes that can come with a consultation fee of having to buy a drink from him. Kobayashi is also flirtatious, often teasing [Natsuo](https://anilist.co/character/127594/Natsuo-Fujii) and asking any men he meets if they're single.",
