However, later she is shown to be anything but bitter, and is even willing to admit her mistakes and be friendly with others. Despite this, she exhibits frequent bouts of jealousy especially when it comes to Ikki.\n\nStella gets agitated whenever anyone says that she is strong because she is an \"A Rank\" and do not see all her hard work, but Ikki Kurogane was the only one to see Stella's hard work which was one of the reasons Stella started developing feelings for him.",
