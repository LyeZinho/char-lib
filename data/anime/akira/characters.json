Tetsuo is shown as a black sheep in the gang he and Kaneda are part of, and quietly suffers from a deeply rooted inferiority complex.

After his psychokinetic abilities manifest, Tetsuo quickly becomes Kaneda's nemesis; he desires Kaneda's motorcycle (a symbol of status and power), and seeks to prove himself supremely powerful, without need of protection.

After she&#039;s discovered that she isn&#039;t a member of The Great Tokyo Empire, she&#039;s denied food and later on recruited by Tetsuo&#039;s aide with three other girls to serve as Tetsuo&#039;s playmates.     Tetsuo gives each of the girls the government-issued drug, and mistaking it for a medicine, Kaori instead saves it for her sick father; which ends up saving her from sharing the fate of the others girls whom end up being killed by the strong effect of the drug.    Her caring and innocent nature earns her Tetsuo&#039;s trust and genuine affection, and she becomes the person to whom he turns for comfort, especially whenever he suffers the strain of the power evolving within him. After Tetsuo begins to mutate and he no longer able to control his powers, his aides plan to assassinate him; hearing of that Kaori takes off to warn him, but gets shot by them.    When Tetsuo finds her dying body, he enters a battle with the American army, then with Kaneda. Later on he attempts to revive her, but fails. He then carries her dead body to Akira&#039;s cryogenic chamber and she was last seen by Kei when she takes cover inside it after Tetsuo&#039;s body goes through another mutation.!~",

Akira's power was so immense that he inadvertantly caused the destruction of Tokyo in 1988 and was secretly sealed afterwards in a cryogenic chamber underneath the destruction site.  *Manga Spoilers*    ~!Unlike in the animated feature, Akira makes an actual appearance in the manga. After his awakening by Tetsuo, he loses control of his power again as he witnesses his friend Takashi being murdered, and the destruction of Neo-Tokyo ensues.  Though he is known as the figurehead of the Great Tokyo Empire--which was established after the destruction of Neo-Tokyo--Tetsuo is actually the one in charge and he uses Akira to perform miracles with his power to control their followers. Kaori is then appointed by Tetsuo to keep him company and look after him.  Akira displays autistic behavior and has actually very few lines throughout the second half of the manga. Though in flashbacks he appears quite happy with the younger versions of Takashi, Masaru and Kyoko. At the end, he's shot by Ryu and joins with Takashi and his friends from the institute to absorb Tetsuo who had lost control of his powers.   Though Akira is gone, he still lives in the hearts of Kaneda, Kei and other survivor who begin to build the Great Tokyo Empire. !~",
