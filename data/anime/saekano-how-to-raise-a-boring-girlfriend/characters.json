      "description": "__Occupation:__ Student / Executive producer / Director / Scenario writer / Manager\n\nTomoya is described as a 'hardcore geek'. However, he is one of the three most notable students at Toyogasaki Academy, along with [Utaha Kasumigaoka](https://anilist.co/character/88750/Utaha-Kasumigaoka) and [Eriri Spencer Sawamura](https://anilist.co/character/88749/Eriri-Spencer-Sawamura), due to his strong advocating of otaku culture at the school.\n\nTomoya is an otaku and prefers reading comics and light novels, watching anime, and playing visual novels above anything else. He is an enthusiastic fan of [Utaha](https://anilist.co/character/88750/Utaha-Kasumigaoka)'s novel Koisuru Metronome. He is the founder and representative member of Blessing Software, serving as the producer, director and programmer. He is also the manager of [Michiru](https://anilist.co/character/88752/Michiru-Hyoudou)'s cover band \"Icy Tail\". When motivated, especially by otaku-related factors, he can be shown to be very hardworking. After his encounter with [Megumi Kato](https://anilist.co/character/88748/Megumi-Katou), his strong desire to make his dream game drives him to take up several jobs for funding. He is extremely tenacious and would do anything to get what he wants, but is easily distracted. He was a typical consumer otaku who would spend the money at his part-time job on anime and games, but his money and time are later devoted to his own games. He is very friendly despite his eccentric personality, and he has a strong sense of morals and conviction when dealing with others.",

Her usual disinterested expression gives off the impression that she is an unapproachable person.

She seems to be calm and quiet, but she actually has a sharp tongue. Utaha can be a little aggressive. Utaha is also very intelligent and is the smartest student in the school. She even writes plays for the drama club as a hobby. She is also a little bit self-centered, but she never talks back to her parents, making her well-mannered. However, when [Tomoya](https://anilist.co/character/88747/Tomoya-Aki) complimented her one time, she acted like a shy, embarrassed girl instead of her usual cold self and called [Tomoya](https://anilist.co/character/88747/Tomoya-Aki) by his first name instead of Rinri-kun.",

She is fickle and naturally good at anything she does. [Tomoya Aki](https://anilist.co/character/88747/Tomoya-Aki) once noted that Michiru had a lot of useless talents. She is not interested in anything but her band and music, and enjoys playing the guitar. Michiru had a prejudice against otaku culture and wasn't happy about [Tomoya](https://anilist.co/character/88747/Tomoya-Aki) being an otaku and tried to get him out of his 'nerd phase' until Tokino Himekawa, Echika Mizuhara and Ranko Morioka (band members) told her they were all otaku. Michiru is a kind and caring girl, but she can also be childish sometimes and she also seems to be naturally cheerful as she is usually seen with a smile on her face. However, she also has shown to be serious and mature.
