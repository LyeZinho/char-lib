  "description": "After last season’s revelations, the Soma family moves forward, but the emotional chains that bind them are not easily broken. Unable to admit why she wants the cure, Tohru wrestles with the truth, aware that time is running out for someone close.\n\nAnd a secret still lurks that could break another’s heart. But hope is not lost—a clue to the curse is found. Could their imprisonment’s end be near?\n\n(Source: Funimation)\n\nNote: This season premiered on Funimation and AnimeLab on March 20, 2021. The Japanese broadcast started two weeks later on April 6, 2021.",
