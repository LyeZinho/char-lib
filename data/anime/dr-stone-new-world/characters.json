He is able to invent various kinds of tools and gadgets in a short amount of time with ease. As a child, he designed and built a functioning miniature rocket ship. Senkuu also possesses an analytical mind, being able to correctly discern the situation he is in. Even in his pre-teens, he was intelligent and sharp-minded enough to create advanced machines.\n\nSenkuu's physical abilities are very low and he would lose against someone like [Kohaku](https://anilist.co/character/124143) in a brawl, something he himself admits.\n\n~!In \"Village Games Arc\" Senku unintentionally won and married [Ruri](https://anilist.co/character/143272), but divorced immediately afterwards.!~",

She appears to be well known in her village due to her combative abilities, as both Kinro and Ginro were afraid of her. Kohaku excels at fighting, hunting, and general survival skills. She is a tomboy by nature, having little interest in more typical feminine activities and has little knowledge about them, although she does seem to enjoy some lavish clothing that was provided to her. She possesses a sharp instinct and intellect.\n\nKohaku is a kind young woman, caring deeply for her sickly older sister, willing to participate in the tournament for her hand in marriage just to protect her. This care extends to her comrades, and anyone she's loyal to. In addition to this, she has a reckless and hotheaded personality, often reacting in anger to being called a gorilla or lioness due to her strength and physicality. She also acts on her emotions at times, going against rational thought. She also has a bit of a teasing side, asking Chrome if he could fall for her to her resemblance to her sister.",

He is genuinely interested in science, although at first, he only knows it as sorcery. He is confident in his intellect, enough so to go toe to toe with Senku despite getting destroyed in a battle of wits. He also has a tendency to refer to something as \"bad\" when he thinks it is cool or amazing. Chrome has a deep love of science, though he admits his expertise and knowledge lies mainly in exploration, particularly pertaining to rocks and minerals and gathering them.\n\nHe is loyal and selfless to his friends and, while lacking in physical abilities, he is still able to think of clever solutions out of dangerous situations. He is also exceedingly brave, and in addition, while he is usually a loudmouth, he knows when to keep his mouth shut. He loves science and, in many ways, is an accomplished scientist in his own right, managing to create chemical reactions from the rocks he collected through frequent trial and error (reactions which were only made known in the seventeenth century), despite never knowing this knowledge before Senku's arrival.",

As such, he lived a wealthy and lavish lifestyle. Pre-Stone World, He has been seen as a greedy playboy, rarely seen without the company of beautiful women, exotic sports cars, and excessive partying. While he is arrogant and greedy, it was his greed that fuelled his ambition, which was the cause of his great success pre-Stone World. He spent a great deal of time studying, and was active in ship making, from making small models, to building huge ships. The money he earned, he put toward bettering himself and the company. Senku deduced that his presence would be beneficial to the Kingdom of Science, as his greed does not only apply to himself, but to those around him. He pushes and motivates everyone.",

Gen is rather quirky and can often be seen speaking in Pig Latin. He tends to be lazy, self absorbed, and perverted, and he is also perfectly capable of lying without a hint of stress or change in expression. While he frequently portrays an aura of selfishness, hard self-interest, manipulation and deviousness, Gen is intrinsically a good person who can't bring himself to harm others. His outward appearance is masked by his mastery in psychology, but his actions tell of loyalty, determination, kindness and even sacrifice at times.\n\nWhile not nearly as intelligent in terms of science compared to Senku, he proves to be his equal and one of his most vital allies due to his ability to understand the human psyche and manipulate people through lies in contrast to Senku's more honest nature. He uses his abilities to promote cooperation and enthusiasm, motivate allies, conduct negotiations, and outsmart enemies. He tends to shift between acting as a ditzy airhead when it suits him (such as to avoid work or going into battle) and an intelligent manipulator. He is confident and is shown to have nerves of steel, even in the face of death.\n\nHe has frequently stated that his favourite drink is cola, and that he cannot handle alcohol.",
