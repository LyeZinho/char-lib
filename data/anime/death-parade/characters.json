In Spring 2004, he becomes a first-year student (freshman) at To-Oh University and gets one of the top scores of its entrance exam.\n\nNicknamed \"Kira\", he uses the Death Note to create his ideal world of justice under him; its new God. Though he looks frail, Light is an extremely athletic person, with an aptitude to find an opponent's weak point. He is a genius, which adds to his notion that only he is fit to judge humanity and steer it on a proper moral course.",
