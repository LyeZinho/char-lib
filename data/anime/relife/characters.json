      "description": "A 27-year old man who seems to fail at every job interview he partakes in. He accepts an offer to be part of the ReLIFE experiment in order to receive a recommendation to a company.\n\n~!In Chapter 221, he learns that Chizuru was a subject of ReLIFE and was shocked to discover she is older than him. After she briefly becomes sad at his possible disappointment, he assures her that he is happy with the revelation and hugs her which surprises but delights her. He then confesses his feelings for her that he is truly in love with her and wishes to be with her forever, and asks her to go out on a date with him. She is very touched by this declaration and states if he is okay with her she'll go out with him on a date, as they smile at each other and share their first kiss.!~",
