      "description": "__Height:__ 175 cm (5'9\")\n\nSaitama is the main protagonist of One Punch Man, and the most powerful hero alive. Having apparently trained himself to superhuman condition, Saitama faces an existential crisis as he is now too powerful to gain any thrill from his heroic deeds.  He is registered with the Heroes Association as a B-Class Superhero and is tasked to defend Z-City against Mysterious Beings. \n\nFor a superhero, Saitama is rather laid-back. Because even the mightiest foes pose no challenge to him, he doesn't take his hero work very seriously. In spite of this, he is constantly searching for an opponent that can challenge him, since his superhero work is beginning to bore him because it's too easy. The combination of his attitude, unstoppable strength, and distinctively simple and 'unimpressive' appearance often cause his battles to become anticlimactic. Saitama will usually allow his opponents to rant about their motives and power up into their strongest forms before suddenly and nonchalantly obliterating them with one punch.",

He's one of the strongest characters in the series and plays a major role as the main villain in the Hero Hunt arc.\n\nGarou is introduced as an evil character with a hatred for heroes and a confident, vindictive personality. He hates being insulted and will attack or kill any who offend him. He thinks highly of himself and uses that assertion to threaten high ranking personal such as heroes and Shicchi. He does not consider other human villains to be allies, wiping out a large group of them along with the heroes present. He will also attack low ranked hero and hero staff members if he encounters them. A large aspect of his personality seems to be some sort of disdain for his former master, Bang, enough to avoid using the Water Stream Rock Smashing Fist he was taught unless seriously cornered.\n\nHe has no remorse even for people who aid him, as he smashed Licenseless Rider's face soon after the latter defended him.\n\nAlthough Garou is an evil character, he possesses some kind of morality: he lets heroes live so that they can grow stronger and fight him again.\n\nIn some ways, Garou can be considered the opposite to Saitama. Where Saitama wanted to be a hero who fought villains from his childhood, Garou wanted to be a monster who defeated heroes. While Garou is a genius fighter, Saitama had to work extremely hard to get his strength.",

His strength is so feared that criminals and mysterious beings will surrender before having to fight him. Appearance: King has slightly long, blonde, brushed back hair along with three long scars on the left side of his face. He wears a turtleneck sweater, has sunken cheeks, a defined jawline and a squarish chin. Notably, a loud drumming sound may be heard in his proximity. The King Engine is a rumbling sound that others claim occurs when King readies for battle or when he is generally serious having an intimidating effect on his opponents. ~! In actuality, it is simply the sound of King's heartbeat which, when he is frightened, is so loud that it can be heard outside his body, but because of King's intimidating reputation people mistake it for bloodlust. King is able to appear to remain calm in threatening situations as well as put out an extremely threatening aura. Despite the intimidating personality King projects, he is actually a coward and an otaku. He has been shown to get very excited about buying a dating game. Saitama saved his life many times, but always end up getting all the credits that was supposed to be for the latter. With this misunderstanding, he came to be known as \"the strongest man on earth\". He got his scars from the Octopus Claw man. !~",

He is considered to be very handsome by the public. Aside from being a hero he is also a famous model, actor and singer, being the most popular one in the world. Sweet Mask has stated that he believes that heroes are to protect the citizens, and if they can't do that, they must become strong enough to be able to do so. He also genuinely cares for the well-being of the citizens around him and actually wishes happiness upon every living thing in the universe. However, befitting the darker side of Sweet Mask's name is his hidden merciless nature. He is shown to have a burning hatred for anything that he sees as evil. Anything that he declares as evil must be swiftly and thoroughly exterminated. \n\nSweet Mask is shown to adhere to any method that makes heroes popular. He notes that only promotions to S-Class or A-Class are fit for his attention, as they are the heroes who draw the most attention from the public, and hence, any heroes in those ranks who earn themselves negative reputations would drag his reputation down as well. Because of this, Sweet Mask stays in the A-Class Rank 1 position to prevent unworthy heroes from promoting to S-Class. \n\nSweet Mask is very narcissistic about \"beauty overwhelming the power\", as he said about his philosophy that \"heroes have to be beautiful as well\". This became obvious when he showed interest in a worthy S-Class Hero like Genos, who has both a beautiful appeal and having done more heroic deeds as the main priority, fitting Sweet Mask's philosophy. \n\n~! However, after witnessing the defeat of Garou by Saitama, his viewpoint changes and becomes more focused on the overwhelming power of the individual than beauty alone. !~",

He is also unafraid to admit defeat, for example, when he was outclassed by Tornado during the encounter of Dark Matter Thieves' aircraft.",
