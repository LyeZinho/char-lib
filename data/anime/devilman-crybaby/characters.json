His father has recently went to work in America so he is currently living with his friend Miki's family. He hasn't seen his best friend Ryo in over a month since moving in with Miki's family. When they reunite he is in for a big surprise that will forever change him, his life, and all of mankind.\n\n~!Devilman is Akira Fudo after he merged with Amon in order to save mankind from the demons. While he usually stays in his human form, he turns into Devilman when he needs to fight seriously. Akira still retains his human heart after he becomes Devilman, meaning he can feel love and empathy unlike demons, but his personality changes drastically as a result of the merge.!~",

His father discovered the existence of demons in our world and decided to fight them. He asked his friend Akira for help. Ryo knew that to be able to beat a demon, one had to become a demon. He and Akira went through a ritual to fuse with demons, but in the end, only Akira was able to do so and became Devilman, leaving Ryo remain as a normal human.\n\n~!Ryo's true identity was much more horrible, much more terrifying than he or Akira could've ever imagined. Ryo turned out to be Satan himself, who sought to destroy the world. Satan is depicted as a beautiful hermaphroditic Seraphim angel with twelve wings. However, it is later revealed by Zenon that Satan is in fact in love with Akira. The Devil's love for Akira was developed through the human relationship between Akira and Ryo.!~",
