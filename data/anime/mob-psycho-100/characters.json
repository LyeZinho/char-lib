She guides Reigen and Taro to the building with the ghost in question, after much scepticism about Reigen coming from her boyfriend. She recounts a tale of a man who struck his head on the ceiling of the building after seeing a cockroach, frightening Reigen. The ghost, Ceiling Crasher, haunting her appears, leading Reigen to attempt to exorcise it (unsuccessfully). Reigen calls in Mob, who exorcizes​ the ghost in front of her.!~",

However, once it is revealed that he is a Telepath, he is shown to be standoffish despite his humor and tendency to tease others. He feels lonely given his telepathy and is overwhelmed by the consciousness of society.\n\n~!Takenaka had previously filled a gap in the Telepathy Club to maintain the minimum number of members needed for the club. He had no interest in the club or in telepathy. He worried about how people looked at him because of his club membership, so he decided to leave the club. As a result of him leaving the club, Tome Kurata had to find a new member to keep the club open. He is later revealed to have joined the tennis club.\n\nIn chapter 98 he is revealed to be a telepath. He returned to their former club room investigate the telepathic ringing generated by Mob and Shiratori brothers. He is subsequently recruited to help contact extraterrestrial life, although he only joins out of obligation.\n\nLater, he is revealed to have actually memorized the summoning formation and incantation despite knowing it to be a hoax, as he didn't want to ruin their memory. He proceeds to spend his New Years' with the others after successfully coming into contact with alien lifeforms.!~",
