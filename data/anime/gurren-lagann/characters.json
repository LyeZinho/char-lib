She wields an extensive range of firearms which include a long range sniper rifle (which she uses most frequently) modeled after the Barrett M82 and hand guns (which can be assumed is used for midrange or close combat) and has previous experience fighting Gunmen. Although she is of the same age group as Simon, she is mature and one of the most rational of the group.   ~!Despite always badmouthing Kamina for his reckless behavior, it did not take long for her to confess her feelings to him, which he returns. She was also Simon's love interest, until Simon discovered that she was in love with Kamina. He seems to have given up on her since meeting Nia. In episode 13 she proceeds to tell Simon that she was in love with Kamina in which Simon replied that he already knew. After the war, Yoko decided to not take part in the administration of Kamina City and decided to become a school teacher for the first new children born on the surface, but not before asking Simon to take care of Nia.   After the war with the Anti-Spirall, Yoko became principal of the school she once taught at.!~",

She had no prior contact with humans, except her father, who is also the sovereign of the Beastmen, the Spiral King. She is very curious, pure and innocent, due to growing up sheltered in a peaceful environment, away from all the battles occurring in the outside world. Despite early misgivings, she is quickly accepted by Team Dai-Gurren, much to the (initial) irking of Yoko.\n\n~!During her journey, she develops a strong empathy towards Simon and grows to be his fiancé. After her encounters with Divine Generals Adiane and Guame, she comes to an understanding of the reason Simon found her outside the palace, being forsaken by her father after she started attaining her own will and self-consciousness, as he considered his offspring merely toys to play with as dolls, and decides to join The Team Dai-Gurren as a cook (even though her cooking is unbearable to anybody but Simon) in order to confront her father. In the final battle with Lord Genome, she boards Lagann with Simon and aids him in the destruction of Lord Genome. Seven years after Teppelin's fall, Nia and Simon are engaged, but soon after she is overtaken by the Anti-Spiral race to become a digital messenger.!~\n\n~!Seven days after the return to Earth, she and Simon get married, though she begins to fade away before the shocked crowd and an unsurprised Simon.

Nia corrects him, stating it will never end and that's what they'd worked so hard for. She smiles as Simon says he loves her before she completely fades away.!~",

He is a shark-type Beastman with feline genetics. His appearance is more humanoid than most other Beastmen, except for his cat-like eyes, shark-like teeth, and large clawed paws in place of hands. He is skilled in piloting Gunmen, as well as in unarmed combat. While hunting for food, he attacks Kamina when he found, running into his Gunmen Enki after Yoko intervene in a ensuing fight between the two. He manages to overcome Simon and Kamina's attacks, but leaves before the fight ends. The next day, Viral returns to execute his mission as member of the Human Execution Squad, facing Kamina and Simon again; this time however, Viral is defeated by the newly formed Gurren-Lagann, barraging it missiles in order to conceal his escape, swearing revenge on Kamina for his humiliation when he took Enki's helmet in the fight.  Viral later returns alongside Supreme General Thymilph and the Dai-Gunzan to crush Team Gurren with the upgraded Enkidu, but is severely injured in the battle, which resulted in the Dai-Gurren's capture and the death of his superior. He tries to obtain another chance to fight by trying to join Supreme General Adiane's side, in spite of her treating him like garbage as she blames him for Thymilph's demise. Still, Viral saved Adiane from harm during a fight with Team Dai-Gurren, by stopping the Dai-Gurren's foot from crushing her. After Adiane's death by the Dai-Gurren's attack and being the only survivor of the Dai-Gunkai, Viral curses the Gurren-Lagann and swears to bring pain and punishment to those who killed his two superiors and robbing him of a honor.  Under Supreme General Cytomander's command, Viral took part on the aerial attack on the Dai-Gurren. His battle with the Gurren-Lagann, piloted by Simon and Yoko, extended to the control room of Cytomander's aerial fortress, the Dai-Gunten. There, he learned of Kamina's death, and discovered that he not only lost to a human, but to a child as well, challenging Simon to a one-on-one duel in their mecha. But the battle was interrupted by Cytomander, who took Yoko hostage, and ordered Viral to destroy the defenseless Gurren-Lagann. However, Viral disobeyed as he knew this outcome would not make him regain his lost pride and honor. For this action, Cytomander asked the Spiral King's permission to execute him for treason, but Viral's last request was hearing from the King himself of what is the true nature of human race. Thus, Lord Genome dispenses Cytomander and conducts Viral to a room where he reveals the truth behind the Beastmen's existance before making him immortal. Viral's last effort against the Gurren-Lagann was in the Spiral King's throne room, where he believed he could finally obtain his vengeance after becoming immortal, but was soundly defeated. Lord Genome revealed that the reason he gave Viral immortality was not to fight against Simon, as none without \"Spiral Energy\" could stand against his power, but to make of him as an eternal witness of his triumph against Team Dai-Gurren.   ~!After Lord Genome's defeat and the fall of Teppelin, Viral's whereabouts were unknown, until he was sighted causing an uproar with his Gunmen, and demanding Simon to fight him, but Rossiu stopped Simon from going after him and sent their Guraparl force instead. Gimmy and Darry together managed to take down Viral's Enkidudu and put him under custody. When questioned by Simon about why he continues to fight even after the war ended, Viral stated that his intention was to protect a human settlement which refused to leave the underground. Simon would eventually discover that Rossiu was forcing people out of their villages without his consent, in order to count them to find out how close mankind's population was from reaching the one million danger level, stated by Lord Genome. Viral is sent to the Rikone prison and reappears in the end of episode 19, when he re-encounters Simon, who was imprisoned there, awaiting for his death sentence to be carried on. Both end up locked in individual cells after a brawl, but after Simon is rescued by Yoko, Viral is also released by him and accepts his proposal to join Team Dai-Gurren against the Anti-Spirals, as the Gurren's pilot. This position is cemented after the battle, when Simon declares him the Gurren's official pilot in a meeting with the Team members; this title goes uncontested.  In episode 26, we discover that Viral's greatest desire is to have a family, however, this will always be impossible, since Beastmen cannot reproduce. Despite being a Beastman, he obtains a Core Drill when broken free from the Anti-Spiral's illusion, even though Beastmen should not be able to produce Spiral Energy. In the epilogue, Viral is seen commanding the Chouginga Dai-Gurren, as a representative for Earth, in the upcoming Spiral Peace Conference; due to his immortality, his appearance stays the same, in spite of the fact that 20 years had passed.!~ Viral's name comes directly from the word \"viral\", tying in with the Beastmen's genetics theme, but there are other theories about his name's origin. One is the fact that it can also be an anagram for \"rival\", referring to his constant rivalry with Kamina, which transfered to Simon throughout the series until near the end. Another possible theory comes from the Nikopol Trilogy of comic books written by Enki Bilal, as Enki is the name of Viral's first Gunmen and \"Bilal\", pronounced in Japanese, sounds like \"Viral\". Supporting this theory is Viral's theme song, which is titled \"Nikopol\", on the anime's soundtrack.  The name of Viral's Gunmen may be tied to the Sumerian diety Enki, though it is much more likely that there is a deliberate connection between his second Gunmen, Enkidu, and the character of Enkidu from the Epic of Gilgamesh. The myth consists of Enkidu ('Enki's creation'), a man of the wild who seeks to challenge King Gilgamesh, a mighty warrior, but who later befriends him and assists him in in his travels.",

She is good friends with her fellow General, Thymilph, though Guame jokes that they had a closer relationship. She implies this friendship was strong because both Guame and General Cytomander treat her as an inferior because of her gender, while Thymilph respected her as a warrior.     After Thymilph&#039;s death, Adiane is stunned and vows revenge, volunteering to attack the Team Dai-Gurren when given the opportunity by Lordgenome. Though she refused his aid as she blamed him for Thymilph&#039;s death, Adiane recruits Viral after he saved her from being crushed by the Dai-Gurren after an attempt to execute Nia once she learns Lordgenome abandoned her. But because of her boasting and staking of her pride on the task, Adiane refuses to return to Teppelin until she destroys Team Dai-Gurren, using the sea to her advantage when the Dai-Gurren crosses it on its way to Teppelin.    Having Viral pilot her Dai-Gunkai to drag the Dai-Gurren into the cold depths, Adiane engages in personal combat with the Gurren-Lagann in her Sayrune to ensure no interference. But the plan fails and Adiane attempts to take Nia hostage until Yoko disables the Sayrune&#039;s shoulder, leaving it opened to close-range fire from the Dai-Gurren&#039;s artillery cannons and killing Adiane instantly in the explosion.    Adiane looks almost completely human, though she has a long, thick scorpion tail and a snake eye. She wears an eyepatch over her left eye and dresses in a loose fitting dress and heels. She is intensely hot and impulsive, often letting her anger get the better of her and land her in sticky situations or taking out her frustrations out on Viral. Despite this impetuous disposition, she is extremely skilled, and is able to battle five powerful Gunmen at once outside of her natural element of water.    Adiane&#039;s name is based on the DNA chemical adenine and the elemental Undine. Her Gunmen, Sayrune, is based on the mythical Azure Dragon, Seiryuu.",

He gives off the impression of one with a perverted mind and showed why when he made snide comments about the relationship between Thymilph and General Adiane. Guame appears to merely respect the Spiral King, unlike the other Beastmen, who worship him as a god. Cytomander makes an interesting statement in episode nine, saying that it was only Guame that could oppose the king. Guame merely said that he and the King had known each other for a long time, which gives off the impression that he has lived as long as or almost as long as the Spiral King has (he later referred to General Cytomander as a \"two-hundred-years-younger upstart\", implying that he is 200 years older than Cytomander). It was Guame who later made it known why Nia was abandoned and that she was not the first princess to be abandoned.  Guame reappears, along with his flagship, the Dai-Gundo. Using Teppelin's power supply, Guame and the Dai-Gundo created a massive tornado, in order to destroy the Great Gurren Brigade and its allies, but his plans are ruined when the Gurren-Lagann tunnels underneath the fortress and impales Guame and the Dai-Gundo into its drill and onto the base of Teppelin.

As a Ganman Pilot, Kittan is a force to be reckoned with, and an asset to the Great Gurren Brigade.  Despite his sometimes obnoxious attitude and eccentric behaviour, Kittan is brave, noble, and willing to do whatever it takes to ensure that his friends escape whatever dangers they may encounter, no matter what the cost.\n\n~!After the war, Kittan became the Chief of the Legal Affairs Bureau in Kamina City, but resigned after discovering about Rossiu's plan to evacuate Earth using the Arc-Gurren, along a small fraction of the human population, and abandoning the rest to die, when the moon falls. Kittan is another character to have Spiral Power. He awakens it when he destroys the Death machine. It allowed him to use the King Kittan Giga Drill Break, which lead to his death.!~",

After the time-skip, she becomes one of Rossiu&#039;s main supporters. After Simon offered himself to protect the city using Gurren Lagann, even after being sentenced to death, Kinon volunteered to pilot Gurren and rig herself with bombs inside its cockpit, claiming that she would detonate them, killing her and Simon in the process, in case of him making an attempt to escape. Later, it is revealed that Kinon&#039;s resolve to follow Rossiu, despite betraying Simon and ordering his execution, was not only the fruit of her devotion to him, but because she thought it greatly pained Rossiu to do so. She strongly believes that he was not doing it for personal gain, but because the circumstances had forced him to it, though if such was really the case is the subject of debate.

It is then up to the Spiral warrior who surrendered to maintain the Spiral&#039;s numbers.    The Anti-Spiral combats opposing Spirals using their highly advanced technology.  Because Spiral energy is fueled by will power and determination, the Anti-Spiral will use methods to instill fear, hopelessness, and absolute despair to subdue any Spiral uprising.

An immortal human who lived for more than 1000 years so far, he cares little for people, treating the strange girls he surrounds himself with as dolls to be cast aside when they've outlived their interest to him. From Guame we find out that Lordgenome despises human consciousness and self-awareness although we are yet to be given a reason for this dislike.  When Simon and Nia finally reach him, he claims that the act of trapping the humans underground and hunting down those who live on the surface is a means he has found to protect mankind, because according to him, when the population of humans on the surface reach one million, a terrible fate will fall upon them. He also shares the fact that he and Simon share the same \"Spiral\" powers, before being defeated via being stabbed in the chest by Simon's Core Drill.  In episode 18, Lordgenome's memories are retrieved by Rossiu's research team, and he reveals to Rossiu the truth about the Anti-Spirals, and the reason why he forced mankind to live underground in order to control its population. It is also revealed that at one time Lordgenome had even been part of a group that fought against the Anti-Spirals, the Spiral Knights, who fought and protected the galaxy from the Anti-Spiral menace. In the end, however, the Spiral Tribe lost the war, and the Anti-Spiral Tribe (The Han-Rasen Tribe) gained control of the universe.  Lordgenome's revived head was used to control the massive spaceship Arc-Gurren. According to Leeron, the ship only reacts to him just like the Lagann only works with Simon. After the Gurren Brigade gained control of the Cathedral Terra, it was relocated there, apparently for the same reason. Source - Wikipedia",

He is good friends with Divine General Adiane, though General Guame insinuates he had a closer relationship with her. He is a skilled tactician and proud warrior, and was ultimately killed when Kamina and Simon destroyed his personal Gunmen, the Byakou, with the Gurren-Lagann.  Thymilph appears as a stoud but large, well-built imposing armored warrior with gorilla features. He is impressively strong, almost always seen as in the company of a large iron hammer he presumably uses in close-quarter combat. A seasoned and confident war veteran, Thymilph has a high respect for caution and shrewdness, but like Viral, possesses a warrior's code of honor. Guame implies that Thymilph was idolized by many Beastmen throughout the Beastmen Empire.  Thymilph's name is based on the DNA chemical thymine and the elemental Sylph. His Gunmen, Byakou, is based on the mythical White Tiger, Byakko.",
