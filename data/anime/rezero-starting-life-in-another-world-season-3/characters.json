Subaru first meets her when her insignia is stolen by Felt as she needs to possess it to be eligible to participate in the election. She introduces herself as Satella when she and Subaru met during the first timeline before introducing herself by her real name when she got her insignia back.\n\nEmilia is good natured and likes to take care of others, though she herself refuses to admit it, instead thinking of it as her own selfishness. She is indifferent to her own appearance, leaving Puck to take care of her clothes and hair. Because her appearance is similar to the Witch of Envy, she has received unfair discrimination from others. She sometimes acts like a child and is unacquainted with the world as she used to live in the woods with other Elves, though despite this she still works hard to become a ruler.",

She has medium length light pink hair that covers her left eye, large darkish pink eyes, and young features. She also has hair clips towards right side of her hair, flower-shaped ribbon on the same side of her hair, and a maid hairband. She looks nearly identical to her sister Rem apart from her hair, eyes, and ribbon coloring. She usually wears a maid uniform. She has a smaller chest compared to her sister, and she has slanted eyes. Ram is seemingly self-centered and does things at her own pace, however in actuality she maintains a distance from people to ascertain them. She believes that Roswaal is the greatest and no one else is as precious except for her sister Rem. She is slightly more outgoing in comparison to the generally taciturn Rem, who generally allows Ram to take the lead in their sisterly bond.\n~! As the prodigal elder twin Ram was born with extraordinary talent for mana manipulation and a powerful body to match that made her the pride of the Oni village. Her aptitude didn't just lie there, everything from cooking to physical activities she was superior to Rem and was showered in adoration even by her own sister. However she never let any of it get to her head and never forgot her little sister no matter how much attention was paid to her. During the night of the attack by the Witch Cult when all the Oni fell she alone kept fighting to avenge them and protect her sister. But the cult outnumbered her and she made a last ditch effort to shield a petrified Rem from getting cut down. In mere moments, Ram lost her horn when it was sliced off from her head as a result of that. Had it not been for a passing mage at the time whom they came to know as Roswaal L Mathers they would not have survived the massacre.\nThe next several years since then Roswaal would gain the twins eternal gratitude and fervent loyalty. Especially in the case of Ram who came to harbor romantic feelings for him who also served as her lifeline due to regular mana infusions. During the early days of her life in Roswaal's mansion Ram would also come to know the partial truth of the cult's raid that night as well as the identity of the cult member responsible for cutting off her horn, Faust with assistance from Roswaal and achieved her vengeance. Ram is the only person who knows about Roswaal's gospel and had formed a contract with him that stipulated that his life would be hers if the future ever deviated from it's predictions as penance for knowing about the attack and letting it happen for his own ends. !~",

      "description": "__Height:__ 7 cm\n\nPuck is an Artificial Spirit that Emilia was formerly contracted with. He is the current Great Spirit of Fire.\n\n~! He is currently known as the Beast of The End. !~\n\n~! Around 400 years ago, Puck was created by Echidna, though he had apparently left her by the time she moved into the Sanctuary. Seven years before the start of the election, Puck unfroze Emilia and began to act as her friend and mentor, and later on started to live at Roswaal's mansion where he was reunited with Beatrice. !~\n\nPuck can be described as cute or adorable, thus his skin being pink around his cheeks. His fur is mostly grey with silver in certain spots (i.e. tip of the tail). His eyebrows are pretty small and rhombus-shaped. He also has a gold earring on his left ear. Sometimes, he carries a purple bag.\n\nPuck is generally a nice spirit. He is very happy and stays at Emilia's side to protect her, affectionately calling her \"Lia\". He occasionally goofs around and gets along especially well with Beatrice. \n\n~!However, Puck's demeanor greatly changes in loops where Emilia dies, showing a complete disregard for anyone except her, and was even willing to destroy the world because of the condition in their contract.!~",
