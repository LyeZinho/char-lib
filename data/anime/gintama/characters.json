      "description": "__Height:__ 177 cm  \n\nA samurai living in an era where a samurai is no longer needed. To add to his troubles, oppressive aliens have moved in to invade. Gintoki lives with Kagura and Shinpachi, taking on odd jobs to make the world a better place...and to pay their rent. In the Joi war, he was known as the \"White Devil\" (Shiroyasha) due to his silver hair and white coat he wore in battle, which, combined with his impressive capabilities as a swordsman, made him famous among his comrades and struck fear into Amanto. Gintoki has naturally permed silver hair, which he blames for his lacking love-life. He has a big crush on the TV's news weather girl, Ketsuno. In fact, to date, the only time he is seen to have blushed is when he tries to make use of Sadaharu and Ketsuno's dog to get a chance to talk to her. Though several female characters have shown an interest in Gintoki, he usually does not show any response back and merely puts up with them as annoyances.  Gin has two major obsessions in life. He is obsessed with sweet foods such as parfait, ice cream, and cake. His second obsession is reading the manga anthology magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump. (Which, not coincidentally, is where Gintama is published in). His favorite type of milk is strawberry milk. Gin will go to great lengths to get the latest Jump issue, to the point of reckless behavior. His Jump obsession makes him easily dream of being like other Jump heroes, including wishing that he had a \"Bankai\" similar to the hero characters of Bleach. Despite his appearance and initial behavior, Gintoki has a great amount of pride for the old Bushido code. He takes it upon himself to rescue or avenge not only his comrades and friends but also people he barely got acquainted too, be it a pit-fighter who was taking care of abandoned orphans or an Amanto who resembles a kappa.   Despite being a fearsome fighter with nearly unmatched skills, he avoids needless bloodshed after suffering the loss of most of his friends and allies during the Joi war.\n\n~!During the Shogun Assassination Arc, Gintoki's past is fully revealed, Alongside Takasugi and Katsura, he was taught at Shoka Sonjuku by Yoshida Shoyou. However Shoyou gets captured by the Tenshouin Naraku for abandoning them when he was still known as Utsuro and much later down the line in the Joui War Gintoki is captured along with Katsura and Takasugi, He has a choice to kill his teacher or his two friends. If he kills his teacher, they will be released; if he kills his friends, his teacher will be released; if he does nothing, everyone dies. Faced with an impossible decision, and not wanting to lose anyone he makes the impossible decision and takes Yoshida Shoyou's head.!~",

However, it seems more like he's just trying to help Gintoki pay the rent than to learn. Shinpachi is the captain of the \"Otsu's Imperial Guard,\" a pop singer's fan club.  Shinpachi meets Gintoki after Shinpachi was tripped by the ambassador of Planet Chatoran. Gintoki beats up the ambassador and his guards, not to stand up for Shinpachi, but to get revenge for his spilled parfait. Gintoki frames Shinpachi for the crime, which somehow led to him saving Shimura Tae (Otae), Shinpachi's sister, from becoming part of a brothel.  Despite his meek appearance, Shinpachi is a more than competent swordsman of his family's Kakidō-Ryu, the type of swordsmanship his dojo teaches.  In the character popularity poll, he was in 8th place.  His name is roughly based on Shinsengumi member Nagakura Shinpachi and comedian Ken Shimura.",

      "description": "__Height:__ 155 cm\n\nAlthough she appears to be a normal, cute, human girl in Chinese-style clothing, she actually belongs to the Yato Clan, one of the strongest and most bloodthirsty of the Amanto races. The Yato is said to have \"transparent\" skin that is highly sensitive to sunlight, so Kagura carries a purple parasol at all times. The parasol is also the Yato clan's weapon of choice; Kagura's is bulletproof and fires bullets from its tip. Because of her Yato blood, she is super-strong and can stop a speeding motor-scooter with one hand. Although stronger than most humans, she cannot control her strength perfectly. Her super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu, have met with an untimely demise at her hands.  She is also extremely flexible and fast; capable of catching multiple speeding bullets between her teeth and fingers. During a battle, she's often seen flipping through the air and performing various acrobatic feats. Due to her Yato blood, she is capable of rapid regeneration. During the Benizakura arc, she is seen healing from a gunshot wound almost overnight.  Kagura also has an unusually strong appetite. She is able to consume large quantities of food within a matter of seconds. Nevertheless, her tastes are endearingly plain. Sukonbu, rice, and eggs are among her favorite foods.  Her immediate family consists of her father, Umibouzu, a widely recognized alien hunter, her mother, who is deceased, and her older brother Kamui, once presumed missing who is now involved with the space pirates Harusame.  She came to Earth to earn money for her family. She found work fighting for a gang, but when they ordered her to kill her target, she ran away. Not long afterward, she met Gintoki and Shinpachi when Gintoki accidentally ran her down with his scooter. After they helped her to make a clean break from the gang, she intimidated Gintoki into hiring her. She now lives at the Yorozuya and sleeps in Gintoki's closet, like Doraemon.  Kagura and Gintoki share an odd father-daughter-like relationship. Together with Shinpachi, the three of them make for a strange, dysfunctional, yet tightly knit family. Kagura is very protective of Gintoki. Although, she herself has gotten into many fights with him, rarely does she let anyone else pick on him. She seems to trust wholeheartedly in Gintoki's ability and strength. Even in sticky situations, she has no doubt that Gin-chan would come to save her. She has a tendency to imitate Gintoki's bad habits, and would often quote the bad advice he gives her. Some of her lines start with \"Gin-chan says...\" or \"Gin-chan told me...\"  Kagura is also somewhat of a tomboy. She is often seen partaking in games with various neighborhood boys. Although her candid manner of speech often causes them to shun her, she doesn't seem to mind. In fact, she has no problem at all with forcing her way into their game. In battle, she has proven to be bull-headed and a sore loser. Like Gintoki, and probably because of his influence, she is not above resorting to petty tricks and manipulation to get the better of her adversary. Unlike many conventional manga heroines, she doesn't display the same consciousness toward decorum, table manners, ​and physical appearance. Puking, cussing, picking her nose, spitting, fighting, and scratching herself is common behavior for Kagura.  She regards Okita, captain of the Shinsengumi, as a rival. She detests him, and appeared to be disgusted when she previously mentioned (about Okita), that \"he definitely likes me\", but as that hasn't been brought up since, it is uncertain if it should be considered canon, that he apparently likes her.  According to the OVA, Kagura is the first and only Weekly Shonen Jump girl to vomit on-screen. To date, she has induced herself to vomit on several occasions. She also has an uncanny knack for seeming calm or detached during high-tension situations; in episode 5, she slept through a car-chase. Her appetite knows no bounds, and she is especially fond of sukonbu.  In Japanese, Kagura speaks in a stereotypical dialect that is associated with Chinese immigrants. In the English-translated manga, she punctuates her sentences with yup, uh-huh, nope, and the like.   ~!In the Yoshiwara in Flames arc, Kagura meets her older brother, Kamui who abandoned her because she was weak in his eyes.!~ In the last Gintama character popularity poll, she came in 6th place.",

He was left in front of Gintoki's apartment in a box that had \"To Mr. Freelancer\" written on it. Sadaharu chomps on anything smaller than itself, such as Gintoki's and other people's heads. Kagura seems to be the only one who can control him, for she has immense strength, though he chomps on her occasionally. Though he was dangerous when Gintoki first received him, he has become quite tame in the later episodes, and has helped the main characters in many occasions. He was named by Kagura, after her first pet, a rabbit which she accidentally killed while having a nightmare. He was originally owned by a pair of miko sisters, who initially called him Kamiko.

Even after the Amanto take-over of Japan, Katsura continues to resist the Amanto, and has amassed a band of followers.\nHe is a wanted man due to his involvement in terrorist activities against the Bakufu, and is constantly on the run from the Shinsengumi. Although his initial methods were originally more violent in nature (for instance, sending a bomb to an Amanto embassy), Katsura has gradually grown to believe that there are people important to him in Edo, and decides that he no longer wants to destroy the country, but believes there should be a way to change it without causing sacrifices.  Katsura seems to be highly respected by his followers, and has even been called the \"Daybreak of the Joui Faction\" by some. When people believed that Katsura had died during the Benizakura arc, even other terrorist groups tried to avenge his death. Since he is a wanted man, Katsura is often seen wearing disguises, although his identity is often still easily found out. \n\nKatsura seems to possess a rather outdated sense of humour, and sometimes refers to things from a past era, such as when he tried to buy a Famicon when people were queuing up to buy the OwEe (a parody of the Wii). He also seems to have a tendency to make up dramatic stories, which moves others to tears when they hear them (except Gintoki). Katsura sometimes works odd jobs to raise money for his terrorist activities. He claims that his heart has started to be moved by Ikumatsu and held his subsequent interview in her ramen restaurant. \n\nHis name is based on the historical Katsura Kogoro.",

His superior is [Katakuriko Matsudaira](https://anilist.co/character/5972), a high-ranking government officer under direct control of the Bakufu. Even though the Shinsengumi are loyal to Kondo, he often has to use Vice Commander [Toshiro Hijikata](https://anilist.co/character/2650) to settle them down (with harsh words or use of violence) before conducting a speech. Kondo is good friends with Toshiro and [Sougo Okita](https://anilist.co/character/2282), and if one of them ever strayed, then the other two would punch him back to where he belongs, as Kondo once told Sougo. Sougo also often remarks that Kondo's nice-guy attitude is also his weakness as he never notices negative points about other people. In the Mutiny arc, he was described by [Kamotaro Ito](https://anilist.co/character/11458) as honest, pure and unsullied. In the same arc, Toshiro described him as the soul of the Shinsengumi, and the rest of them being the sword that protects him. Toshiro also said that everybody joined the Shinsengumi so that they could be with Kondo, and that as long as he was there, the Shinsengumi would not be finished.\n\nWhen Kondo once asked Tae Shimura whether she would still love her boyfriend if he had a hairy butt. She became the target of his stalking when she replied that she would love her boyfriend just as much, hairy butt and all. Being a stalker of Tae, Kondo is often seen getting beat up or threatened by her, as she highly disapproves of his stalking and affection towards her. In the Yagyuu arc, Kondo had his mind set on being [Shinpachi Shimura](https://anilist.co/character/673)'s brother-in-law, even going as far as saying Shinpachi was the only one he could entrust the Shinsengumi to, much to Shinpachi's annoyance, answering that he doesn't give a damn about the Shinsengumi.\n\nDuring his childhood, Kondo was a member of a dojo in Bushuu. There, he would soon meet Sougo and Toshiro, recruiting them both into his dojo. Kondo would later on take all the members with him and move from Bushuu to Edo in search for success, becoming what is now the Shinsengumi. Some characters in the series often call him \"gorilla\" due to his hirsute nature and although he is angered with this nickname, he sometimes uses the same word to identify himself. Kondo is loosely based on the historical Kondo Isami, famed for his role as commander of the Shinsengumi during the Bakumatsu period.",

      "description": "__Height:__ 168 cm \n\nTae Shimura is [Shinpachi](https://anilist.co/character/673)'s older sister. She runs the Kakidokan Dojo—which was her father's failing dojo—with her brother. She is usually addressed as \"Otae\"; the \"O\" is an honorific used to refer to women. [Kagura](https://anilist.co/character/674) always addresses her as \"big sister\" (anego). Despite her sweet face, she is one of the most violent characters in _Gintama_ (and arguably strong too). She mercilessly beats up [Isao Kondo](https://anilist.co/character/2943) and [Gintoki Sakata](https://anilist.co/character/672) whenever they anger her; in episode 19, she mercilessly kicks the men out onto the road (namely her brother, Gintoki and [Taizou Hasegawa](https://anilist.co/character/3760)) so as to stop a car for a hitch ride. She often displays her trademark sweet-looking smile with her eyes closed before engaging in her violent activities. Her killer intent is so strong that on one occasion, a stare from her brings the entire Shinsengumi on their knees begging for mercy. Her weapon of choice seems to be a naginata, a Japanese spear.\n\nHer cooking skills are terrible, seeing as her tamagoyaki (i.e. sweet fried egg) is so inedible that Kondo suffers amnesia after eating it and others are barely able to swallow it down. [Sagaru Yamazaki](https://anilist.co/character/4653) even describes it as \"poison\" after some of it accidentally gets into his eye. When Kagura tried to hypnotize herself into eating Otae's cooking, Shinpachi objected, saying that Otae's cooking is the reason for his poor eyesight.  She has, so far, been called flat-chested three times in the anime; another in 59 by Gintoki; and the third time by Shinpachi, who thought that [Kyubei Yagyu](https://anilist.co/character/6110) wanted to marry her because Kyubei took her as a male (that her chest is so flat that she looks like a guy). She has strong principles and believes in maintaining what is precious, even if it means throwing away honor and dignity. She once says that if apologies were enough, seppuku would not exist. Her favourite food is Häagen-Dazs ice-cream, but it is called Bargain Dash in the manga and anime.",

His favorite phrase is \"AHAHA! It must be _____\". He also has a tendency to misspell names; he calls Gintoki \"Kintoki\". Gintoki often corrects him, citing that if he were named Kintoki, they would be in some kind of hentai anime (because 'Kin' from 'Kintoki' instead of 'Gin' would make the title 'Kintama', which means 'testicles' instead of 'Gintama', which means 'silver soul').  \n\nDespite his goofy nature, Sakamoto is actually a successful businessman in the galaxy. He believes that business is a way of protecting his country. He has a private, well-equipped defensive business fleet. He believes that sacrifices should be made for the good of the community, which is why he chose to abandon his comrades on Earth to travel into space. Sakamoto is shown to be skilled with a pistol in an anime filler episode.\n\nHis name is based on the historical character Sakamoto Ryouma. He speaks in Tosa-ben, much like the inspiration for his character.",

      "description": "Elizabeth resembles a giant white duck or a giant penguin and is Katsura's companion. Elizabeth was a present from Tatsuma Sakamoto, who presumably picked it up on his travels around space. Although many people consider Elizabeth to be insane and extraneous, Katsura has named the ambiguous avian \"Elizabeth\" and dotes on it. Once in episode 18 Shinpachi purchased a doll named as Space Alien Stefan (宇宙怪獣ステファン) to which looks perfectly similar to Elizabeth. Elizabeth is something of a painter, and is surprisingly dexterous. Also, Elizabeth resorts to using signboards to \"communicate\", as well as an occasional means of attack. Elizabeth is also a skilled fighter, able to use signboards to fight off swordsmen.  Although the true identity of Elizabeth is uncertain, it appears to be a man wearing a duck costume. In its first appearance, hairy legs are seen underneath her sheet and the body of a humanoid with glowing eyes is revealed as her mouth is opened just as it fell during another battle between Gintoki and Katsura. Although Katsura seems shocked at what she really is, she has subsequently remained by his side. Episode 50 implies that the person inside Elizabeth is most likely the director (Gintoki was interrupted before he can finish being cut off at \"Kanto-\" (\"Direc-\"). Most of the characters seem to ignore this, or at least do not give it much thought, given at the episode was completely filler. Moreover, the next time the inside of Elizabeth is shown, it reverts to the glowing eyes. When Shinpachi boards Takasugi's ship in order to rescue Kagura, a bazooka is seen coming out of Elizabeth's mouth when she blasts the ship to distract everyone from Shinpachi. Because of this, Shinpachi refers to her as Elizabeth-senpai.  Elizabeth's birthday is September 7. \"Her\" height is 180 centimeters, and \"she\" weighs 123 kilograms.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Bansai is shown to have an extremely calm demeanor, which covers up the fact that he has a vicious, almost cruel personality which actively seeks out conflict. \n\nHe carries and is skilled at playing a shamisen, which also doubles as a tool for tying others up or as a weapon similar to a garrote. On top of being famous as a skilled swordsman, Bansai is also a talented songwriter. He works as a music producer under the name &quot;Tsunpo&quot;, and Otsu&#039;s newer songs are written by him. \n\n ~!During a major fight in the Silver Soul War, Bansai sacrificed his life in order to protect his fellow members of the Kiheitai.!~\n\nBansai&#039;s name is roughly based on that of a hitokiri of the Bakumatsu era, Kawakami Gensai, while his stage name is based on the musician Tsunku.",

He is easily recognisable through his bandaged left eye, his colorful  kimono, his eerie smile, and the pipe he is often seen smoking.\n~!He now leads a radical Joui faction called the Kiheitai and is known amongst the Shinsengumi as 'the most dangerous man in both the Joui faction and amongst the radicals'.!~\n\nHe, Gintoki, and Katsura studied in the same temple elementary school when they were children, and he fought with them against the Amanto invasion during the latter part of the Joui war. After the war ended, he vanished, and has since gained a dangerous reputation due to his assassination of many of the Bakufu's main officers and his planning of a large-scale coup d'etat. Before his first appearance in both the anime and the manga, he was mentioned to have fled Edo and to have been hiding in Kyoto, although it is unclear how long before this was.  He now believes that the only way to save it is to destroy the \"rotten\" post-Joui war world.\n\nHe is shown to like festivals, although this is mainly due to the opportunity they provide for a large-scale terrorist attack: he appears to have an attraction to ruin that is almost nihilistic. He also appears to have considerable insight due to his 'seeing through Itou's heart' and subsequently planting him in the Shinsengumi's ranks.  It can be assumed that he is as skilled a swordsman as both Gintoki and Katsura, having fought alongside them as one of the 'heroes' of the Joui war. That aside, he appears to have at least considerable skill in playing the shamisen, and is shown at one point playing it with Bansai as they talk.",
