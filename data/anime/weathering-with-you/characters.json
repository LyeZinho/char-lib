      "description": "__Height__: >173 cm\n\nHodaka is a high school student of average build with medium length black hair and light brown eyes. He is often seen wearing a plain black t-shirt and jeans along with his yellow knapsack that he carries along everywhere he goes. Hodoka ran away from his parents and home to live a new life in Tokyo as his previous life was too \"suffocating\" for him. However, after arriving in Tokyo, he struggled to live the new life he was hoping for and was forced to live in manga cafes and in the streets. Fortunately, he met [Keisuke Suga](https://anilist.co/character/139707/Keisuke-Suga), a writer for a small editing company, who took him in as an employee and gave Hodoka a roof over his head.\n\nHodoka is a courageous boy as he was able to leave his home by himself and start a new life in Tokyo. Accompanying his courageous trait however is an impulsive nature which often leads him to make irrational choices that cause many misunderstandings.",

She possesses the ability to clear the weather for a short period of time in a desired area by praying to the sky which she obtained after praying and walking through a Torii (traditional Japanese gate) on the roof of an abandoned building.\n\nHina is a cheerful, energetic, and strong-willed teen. She is also a caring and kind individual as seen when she gives Hodoka a free burger when she noticed he looked lost. She uses her power to clear the weather to brighten people's days and see the smiles on their face.\n\n~!It was later revealed that she's only 15 years old.!~",
