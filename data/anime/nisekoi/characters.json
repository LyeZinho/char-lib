      "description": "__Height:__ 160 cm\n\nThe main female protagonist of the series. She is the daughter of [Adelt Wogner Kirisaki](https://anilist.co/character/82935) and [Hana Kirisaki](https://anilist.co/character/84919) who served as the fake girlfriend of [Raku Ichijou](https://anilist.co/character/48393) for the next three years of her school life to prevent a war from starting between their families.\n\nChitoge is somewhat a forgetful, stern and bold girl. However, once someone gets to know her better, she becomes very talkative and nice. Similar to Raku, Chitoge is the type to go out of her way to help someone. For example, when Raku lost his pendant once again from the chain being broken, Chitoge had secretly gotten the Beehive gang to help fix it for him and gave it back later that night. Chitoge is somewhat oblivious when it comes to love and others' love interests, for example, how she didn't know what [Seishirou Tsugumi](https://anilist.co/character/58885)’s \"symptoms\" were, which were actually love. She is also very athletic as she can easily jump over the school's walls and swim the length of the school pool in a couple of seconds. Ever since she was a child she had a hard time making friends as they disliked her. As a result, she had a cold demeanor toward people at the start of the series due to her relationship with her family. This led her to create notebooks filled with information on classmates in an attempt to make friends. When Chitoge had lost her ribbon, she becomes very emotional and sad, wanting to find the ribbon very badly. Unlike her usual self, when [Marika Tachibana](https://anilist.co/character/66597) insulted her for caring so much about a ribbon, she cried innocently, scaring the girl into speaking in her accent and helping in finding the ribbon. Raku also noted that she felt more womanly as Chitoge was meek and quite happy when he tried to buy a replacement ribbon for her and when she hugged him for finding her actual ribbon, but prefers her usual self better. It should be noted that she treasured the ribbon for two key reasons: because her mother gave it to her, and secondly because Raku told her when they were young that it would look good on her.\n~!In the end of the manga it is shown that Chitoge became a fashion designer and she and Raku got married.!~",

      "description": "**Height:** 157 cm\n\nShe is one of the main characters in the manga series Nisekoi. She is shown to have a crush on [Raku Ichijou](https://anilist.co/character/48393/Raku-Ichijou), the male protagonist of Nisekoi, and is also the only girl that Raku openly has feelings for.\n\nKosaki is discreet, innocent, and slightly timid. She is very kind, she takes care of Raku when he is wounded or ill. Generally, she opts to think carefully before acting, as seen when she stalls her confession to Raku in consideration that he may have feelings for [Chitoge](https://anilist.co/character/48391/Chitoge-Kirisaki).  \n\nIn confrontation with Raku, Kosaki displays inconfidence, initially needing encouragement from [Ruri](https://anilist.co/character/58281/Ruri-Miyamoto) attempt confessing her love.  \n\nKosaki works well with her classmates, possessing close friends and being the most popular girl for the boys before Chitoge transferred and after Kosaki and Raku allegedly began dating.   \n\nBoth Kosaki and Raku are completely unaware that the feelings they hold for each other are mutual. Like in many average fictional love stories, these two try not to show their feelings to each other. She loves Raku because he is kind and caring. Just like the other girls who like him, she can be jealous as well but not to the point of having bloodlust. She often worries/wonders whether Raku and Chitoge's \"fake relationship\" is actually developing into something more than just that. \n\nChitoge and Kosaki have a really trusting relationship. It can even be considered that they are best friends since Chitoge only tells her problems to her (except in some cases, Raku as well). Despite her knowing that Chitoge and Raku are only pretending to date, she at times can't help but be suspicious of their relationship. \n\n~!In the end of the manga, Kosaki is revealed to be The Promise Girl, who had made a promise of marriage with Raku when they were young.!~\n\n(Source: Nisekoi Wikia)",
