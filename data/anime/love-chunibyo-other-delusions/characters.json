      "description": "__Height:__ 150 cm (4'11\")\n\nRikka Takanashi is an active Chuunibyou, who still has the syndrome. Her delusional syndrome involves her right eye which she calls her \"Wicked Eye,\" which, according to her, wields darkness tamed by the power of a pure heart. In reality, her so-called \"Wicked Eye\" is nothing more than a colored contact lens which she conceals underneath an eyepatch. Despite being quite attached to Yuuta, she is cautious of strangers and adopts a battle pose whenever she meets someone for the first time. She is also rather clumsy, often tripping over and forgetting things. She also doesn't have many friends, as shown that in her mobile phone only has her sister's email.  \n\n~!Rikka's father died in the past, which she stubbornly denies. In the process, she one-sidedly met Yuuta, who was an active chuunibyou at that time, and was amazed by how cool Yuuta was as the Dark Flame Master. Her belief that her father is in the \"horizon\" is the cause of her chuunibyou.!~  ~!Rikka eventually falls in love with Yuuta and makes a contract with him.!~",

One of the most popular girls in the class due to her looks, she is generally thought of a kind and gentle girl.   ~!She too suffered a case of eighth-grader syndrome, going by the name of Forest Summer. Like Yuuta, she chose a school that none of her former classmates were going to so she could escape from her embarrassing past.   When she is with Yuuta, Rikka, and the others in the clubroom, her usual happy, sweet demeanor fades and she is blunt, edgy, and tends to fight with Dekomori quite a lot. This is because Dekomori admires Forest Summer (and does not believe Shinka is actually Forest Summer, constantly referring to Shinka as \"fake Forest Summer\") and has numerous copies of books, consisting of documents that Forest Summer had written, titled Mabinogion. Shinka seeks to destroy every last trace of her past, and Dekomori is a barrier against this, causing frequent fights between them.!~",
