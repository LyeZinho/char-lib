      "description": "__Height:__ 180 cm (5'11\")\n__Nationality:__ American-Irish\n\nAsh has the personality, charisma, and skill to gather large groups of individuals together under his influence. Not only is he excellent in combat and an incredible marksman, but he's also highly intelligent with an IQ of 200. His intelligence lends itself well to solving the mystery of 'Banana Fish' and he has also been stated to be quite well-read, knowing his way around the newspaper's daily columns and political novels - unusual for someone who did not finish middle school.\n\nAlong with his remarkable intelligence, Ash's good looks and charisma allow him to sway the will of people to his benefit in dire situations, and he's well aware of it. Despite the influence he holds over others, however, Ash is mistrustful and holds most people at arms-length except for a few select friends in his inner circle, the most notable being Eiji Okumura. He is not afraid of death not because of courage, as he calls himself a coward, but because of his disillusionment with his own life.\n\n(Source: Banana Fish Wiki)",

      "description": "__May contain spoilers:__  &quot;Max Lobo&quot; is the pen name of Max Glenreed, a good-natured Vietnam veteran, former cop, journalist, novelist, and jailbird. As a journalist, Max wrote a regular column for the Village Tribune. He also wrote a novel about the Vietnam war called Seven Hundred and Thirty Days in Saigon. When we first meet Max in the manga, he is jailed for punching a cop. However, considering his cozy relationship with Charlie, Antonio, and even the prison guards, there is a strong suggestion that Max is keeping himself in jail as long as he wants. He practically brags that he could get out at any time; however, staying locked up seems to be serving the purpose of good old-fashioned investigative journalism.    Ever since the Vietnam war, Max has been hot on the trail of &quot;Banana Fish,&quot; and has secretly been collecting notes and research for years. In Vietnam, his close friend Griffin Callenreese took some illicit drugs and went on bad trip, going on a shooting rampage and killing fellow members of his unit; it was Max, ultimately, who shot Griff&#039;s legs out from underneath him and stopped the carnage. Max had to abandon Griffin to the &quot;nut house&quot; in Saigon, although after the end of the war, he spent years searching for Griffin&#039;s whereabouts. To this day, Max is haunted by the memory of Griffin. Later on in the story, this guilt drives him to protect Ash from danger, despite the antagonistic relationship that Ash initially forces him into.    Max provides a lot of comic relief in the story. He sometimes acts as a fool, sometimes as an idiot savant. He loves his son and his ex-wife, Jessica, even though he is deathly afraid of Jessica&#039;s temper.    In an interview, Akimi Yoshida said that Max&#039;s character design was based on actor Harrison Ford.    (Source: boukenshin.net &amp; HotaruKara)",

Like Ash, Shorter is an unusual \"thug\" with a deep sense of honor, and a drive to always do the right thing. He'll go to any lengths to protect his loved ones... even when the interests of those closest to him come into irreconcilable conflict.\n\nShorter is clever, resourceful, and as tough as steel. He's equally skilled at brawling, shooting, and sneaking around like a shadowy thief. Shorter can disguise himself as a completely different person, and fool even Eiji into thinking that he is a dotty old Chinese man.\n\nShorter has an irrepressible sense of humor and can wear a lopsided, devilish grin even during the grimmest of circumstances. Like Ash, he is a charismatic leader who can easily unite the other kids on the street under his rule.\n\nAt the beginning of the series, Shorter has a mohawk hairdo. But by volume two he has shaved off all of his hair and is completely bald. Shorter's trademark fashion statement is his ever-present sunglasses. He even wears them while sneaking around a cornfield in the middle of the night! In an interview, Akimi Yoshida said that Shorter's character design was inspired by Sanburaza Nakano. \n\n(Source: boukenshin.net, HotaruKara)",
