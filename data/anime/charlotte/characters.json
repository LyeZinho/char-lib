      "description": "__Height__: 150 cm  \n\nKanade Tachibana is the Afterlife School's student council president. She is often referred to as \"Tenshi\" by the SSS, based on both Yuri's belief that she must be a representative of god and the SSS members not knowing her name initially. Though, they continue to called her as \"Tenshi\" after discovering her real name. Her position often puts her at odds with Yuri and the other SSS members as her responsibilities require her to suppress delinquency and disruptive activities. \n\nHer given name, Kanade, as described by Otonashi, literally means \"Playing music\".\n\nTenshi has a variety of self-defense skills at her disposal, which she calls \"Guard Skills\".   \n\n~! __Hand Sonic:__ Calls forth a blade on one hand or both. The blades are capable of slicing through steel. Kanade has shown several variations to its form:\n-  _Version 1:_ Regular shape, resembling a longsword. \n- _Version 2:_ A longer version than the previous, with a curved diamond shape on its tip. \n- _Version 3:_ Shaped like a traditional sai. \n-  _Version 4:_ A variation which is shaped like a lotus flower with no edges other than, perhaps, its petals. Apparently more of a bludgeoning weapon than a slicing one. Tenshi admits to have created it in her attempt to make her weapon \"cuter\". \n- _Version 5:_ Kanade's most recent variation of Hand Sonic. Is basically a pair of pincers secured on the arm by a blue gauntlet-like accessory. She created this version out of Otonashi's advice to make a more ruthless image.\n __Distortion:__ Distorts the path of bullets or any other projectiles around or away from her body.   \n__Delay:__ Creates a sort of after-image for close range. It is effective in dodging melee attacks by confusing the enemy into attacking elsewhere.  \n __Harmonics:__ Makes a clone of herself which is identical to her except the clone has blood-red eyes. Clones created through this ability have their own consciousness and have all the abilities of the original - including Harmonics itself. This ability is apparently sightly glitched, as her clones were shown to rebel against her to the extent of almost killing her.  \n __Absorb:__ A reverse of Harmonics. It allows Kanade to reintegrate Harmonics clones back into the original's body. However, since every clone has their own consciousness, using this poses some risks. The skill uses a command called timewait, which delays the execution. This was created by Yuri as a method of dealing with the clones.\n__Overdrive:__ A passive ability that gives her superhuman strength.   \n__Howling:__ Emits powerful high-frequency, high-amplitude sound-waves from crossed Hand Sonic blades, meant to make an enemy faint. Created by one of the Harmonics clones.   \n__Angel Wings:__ Sprouts wings from her back that can be used to slow descent and let her survive drops such as jumping from the roof of a building. Purely decorational, as she could survive the drop easily to begin with.   \n__Energy Blast:__ This unnamed technique produces a blue explosion that is shot out of her back in a vaguely angel wing-shaped blast. It was stated to be as powerful as a bomb by Naoi, after it demolished a mass of Shadows. !~ \n\n(Episode 13 spoilers)\n~! It is revealed that Kanade was the receiver of the donor heart from Otonashi. Her regret in life was her inability to thank the one who gave her the heart. After the credits, there is a short scene featuring what is assumed to be her and Otonashi reuniting in the real world !~",
