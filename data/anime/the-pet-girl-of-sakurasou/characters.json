She is a world-famous artist who transferred into Suiko as a second-year to learn how to draw manga. Although her artwork is widely admired by the world, in spite of her young age, she knows nothing other than drawing and has an extreme lack of common sense and living ability. Due to this, Sorata is forced to handle Mashiro's living chores, to the point that he even has to pick out underwear for her, or she will go out without them.   \n~!In the third novel, Mashiro starts to grow feelings for Sorata, and she even claims that she cannot live without him. In the eighth novel Sorata confesses his feelings for her and in the next novel, they are officially a couple.!~ Given her only academic strong point is art, she does very poorly in other subjects. Utilizing her photographic memory allows her to succeed in these subjects. \n~!It is heavily implied in the last volume of the novel that Mashiro and Sorata had a child.!~",

She is very outgoing and optimistic. Sorata often refers to her as an \"alien\". She has very good grades and is very good at drawing, but the school decided to send her to Sakurasou Dormitory because she pays too much attention on drawing anime and manga. She is very good at making animation and can handle most work in making one without help from others. She has already sold an animation to a famous publishing company and made enough of a fortune for the rest of her life. ~!She has feelings for Jin, and acts very open to express her feelings, but Jin turns a blind eye to this and dates many other girls, which makes her very depressed. The two finally become a couple during the fifth novel. In sixth novel, she registers their marriage without asking Jin, making them officially husband and wife; her new name is Misaki Mitaka. She moves next to the Sakurasou Dormitory after her graduation into a house which she designed and built herself and has a recording studio in the basement.!~\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
