      "description": "__Height:__ 166 cm (5'5¼\")\n__Quirk:__ One For All\n\nStudent in Class 1-A at U.A High School.\n\nAlthough he was born without a Quirk, Izuku's innate heroism and strong sense of justice manages to catch the attention of the legendary hero All Might. Izuku has since become All Might's closest pupil.\n\nIzuku is a very timid, reserved, and polite boy. Although initially portrayed as insecure, tearful, and vulnerable, Izuku gradually matures into a more confident and braver person. His infectious leadership skills, combined with his passion and strategic abilities, have turned Izuku into a central figure of Class 1-A. He is caring and emotional, never hesitating to help or rescue someone in danger, even if he knows that he might not be strong or otherwise qualified enough to do it.\n\nIzuku is extremely (and sometimes scarily) enthusiastic about topics related to heroes. His dream drives him to write down notes about everything he learns about heroes' Quirks and fighting capabilities. Thanks to this practice, Izuku has developed a great analytical mind and can form complex battle plans in a few seconds, factoring in the best ways he can utilize the Quirks of allies and enemies alike for his own advantage.\n\nIzuku's Quirk \"One For All\" was transferred to him from All Might. His Quirk allows him to stockpile an enormous amount of raw power, allowing him to significantly enhance all of his physical abilities to various boundless levels. This results in unbelievable levels of strength, speed, stamina, agility, and durability. Izuku can focus the stockpiled power into a single body part, or spread it across his entire body evenly, though, focusing the power in a single part puts a greater strain on that part of his body.",

Due to the constant praise of his abilities and powerful Quirk, Katsuki has developed a superiority complex, and because of that, he desires to be the first and best at everything. He loves to win above all else and cannot stand it when he doesn't, leading him to lose his already short temper if he achieves anything but a complete victory.\n\nKatsuki is not only very athletic and talented at fighting, but also very intelligent and extremely perceptive, capable of strategic planning and improvisation. Additionally, his grades are among the highest of his class. Katsuki also possesses surprising talent in other areas, such as cooking and music, even though he doesn't show a particular interest in them. Overall, Katsuki is considered a natural-born genius with the potential to be one of the best Pro Heroes.\n\nKatsuki's Quirk \"Explosion\" allows him to secrete nitroglycerin-like sweat from the palms of his hands and ignite it on command, allowing him to create strong explosions. The more Katsuki sweats, the stronger his explosions become. Not only can Katsuki use the explosions for attacking, he can also use them to propel himself and navigate through the air at high speeds, allowing him to fly at his opponents without giving them time to react, as well as evade incoming attacks, even while in the air. The shockwave from an explosion can even be used as a shield.",

High School, where he got in through official recommendations. He is the youngest son of the top hero Endeavor.\n\nShouto initially has a cold, aloof personality, which stemmed from his complicated family life. Focused and unemotional, Shouto preferred to keep things to himself instead of hanging out with others. After the events of the U.A. Sports Festival, however, he notably became more sociable and kinder than ever before. He even gained a sense of humor and would occasionally smile, although still retaining some fragments of his previous distant attitude and nonchalant demeanor. While usually quiet and reserved, Shouto initially possessed a moderate level of arrogance, which, combined with his solitary tendencies, sometimes made him take the initiative without considering the opinions of others.\n\nShouto's Quirk Half-Cold Half-Hot gives him the ability to generate ice from the right side of his body, and flames from his left side. Due to years of rejecting his father, Shouto has developed a habit of favoring ice, even when fire would be a better option. This grudge also caused him to have difficulty controlling his flames. If he overuses one element without utilizing the other, then his own body temperature will suffer.",

Tenya is very humble, willing to admit to his mistakes, apologize for rude behavior, and improve in areas he lacks. Being part of the highly-esteemed Ida Family of Heroes, Tenya is proud of his lineage and works hard to meet his expectations. He greatly admires his older brother, Tensei (also known as the Turbo Hero: Ingenium), and aspires to become a similar hero.\n\nTenya's Quirk Engine gives him car-like engines in each of his calves, giving him incredible running speed and extreme kicking power.

He was raised by his master, All For One, with the goal of killing All Might, and ultimately destroying the society he represents.\n\nTomura is a very twisted, malevolent, and maliciously warped young man, who is considered to be the polar opposite of Izuku Midoriya. He doesn't care for his or almost anyone else's life, having no qualms about performing evil deeds like murdering innocent people. Tomura was initially perceived to be a \"man-child\": arrogant, selfish, dependent, and demanding, becoming angry if things didn't go his way and likening reality to some sort of video game. Unlike his mentor, Tomura lacked subtlety, preferring to eliminate problems through force. Much like a child, Tomura seemed unable to cope with his own feelings, instead lashing out and abusing both others or himself, tearing at his own neck when he becomes frustrated. \n\nInitially, Tomura seemingly caused destruction just for the sake of it and felt directionless about the League's path forward after Stain's arrest. It would take a fateful meeting with Izuku in a mall for him to develop an epiphany and become aware of his true convictions: to crumble hero society through All Might's death.\n\nTomura's Quirk allows him to disintegrate whatever he touches with all five fingers. It will take effect whether the target is organic or not. The disintegration spreads quickly and will spread through the victim's whole body if they don't amputate the decaying body part. His Quirk can even spread beyond what he's touching, allowing him to disintegrate large groups of enemies instantly.\n\n(Source: My Hero Academia Wiki)",

Overusing her Quirk or pushing it too far can also be fatal, as it dehydrates her body very fast. Mina can use her acid offensively, but has shown utility with it as well, such as melting handholds for herself to climb with.

A recurring joke is that others view Mashirao as \"plain,\" which profoundly upsets him.\n\nMashirao's Quirk is that he has a long, powerful, sturdy tail. His tail effectively functions as a third arm that he can use to grab things. Furthermore, it's attack power is strong enough to break objects made of metal, he can wrap it around enemies, and it can support Mashirao's body weight. Mashirao is incredibly adept at using his tail, combining it with his knowledge of martial arts to engage enemies in close-range combat, performing fast and acrobatic moves. His tail can also increase his speed and mobility by whipping it down against the ground to use it like a springboard.\n\n(Source: My Hero Academia Wiki)",

He believes that those who become Heroes for fame or money are unworthy of being called the name and only All Might is a true hero. Due to his strong ideology, he took it upon himself to become the Hero Killer: Stain to stain his own hands with blood to purge fake heroes and change the current society. \n\nDespite his extremist views and beliefs, Stain did have genuine ideals about heroism, which he stood by firmly. He did not hesitate to save people he deemed worthy of being called Heroes, did not like killing without reason, and would even give advice to his enemies. Stain acknowledged that what he did was morally wrong but believed that for society to be put on the right path, someone must be what he was, suggesting that he saw himself as a martyr.\n\nStain's Quirk \"Bloodcurdle\" allows him to paralyze his target upon tasting a sample of their blood.

Inspired by these comments, Stendhal cuts off his broken nose and abandons his mask, declaring that he will dye the world with \"stains that cannot be wiped away.\" !~",

He is the son of Enji and Rei Todoroki, the younger brother of Toya and Fuyumi, and the older brother of Shoto.\n\nNatsuo is a young man of average height, sporting white spiky hair with two small pieces of hair hanging down by his forehead. He greatly resembles his father at his age.\n\nNatsuo seems to be a care-free individual, as seen in his interactions with him and his family. However, he can be serious, and cares deeply for his family, except his father who he resents for his abusive treatment to his family. He does not feel forgiving to his father, blaming him for his mother Rei's hospitalization and Shoto's suffering.\n\n(Source: MHA Wiki)",
