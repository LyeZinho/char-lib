  "description": "When Sakamoto meets Aoi, the convenience store clerk, it’s love at first sight — and just like that, he retires.\n\nSakamoto gets married, has a daughter, opens a mom-and-pop store in a quiet town, and completely transforms … into a plus-size man. To ensure a peaceful life with his beloved family, the legendary ex–hit man bands together with comrades to face off against the looming threat of assassins.\n\n(Source: Netflix TUDUM)\n\nNote: The series streamed a week in advance on Netflix Japan starting with episode 2 released alongside episode 1.",
