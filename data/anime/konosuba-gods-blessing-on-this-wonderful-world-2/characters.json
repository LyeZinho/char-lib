She is also a very direct and honest person, and although she's usually calm, she knows how to hit someone back when she is teased. Her level-headedness compared to the boys in her party often leads to her getting Dust out of trouble and scolding him for his actions.\n\nDespite her strict demeanor however she is a pleasant person, and at times shows genuine kindness and concern for Dust as well.",
