The story covers 13 years and begins with a 19-year-old college student named Hana who encounters and falls in \"fairy tale-like\" love with a \"wolf man.\" After marrying the wolf man, Hana gives birth and raises two wolf children&mdash;an older sister named Yuki who was born on a snowy day, and a younger brother named Ame who was born on a rainy day. The four quietly lived in a corner of a city to conceal the existence of the \"wolf children,\" but when the wolf man suddenly dies, Hana decides to move to a rural town far removed from the city.\n\n(Source: Anime News Network)",
