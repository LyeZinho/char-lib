At the beginning of Monster he is favored by the department director for his prodigious surgical skill. After a crisis of conscience, he chooses to save the life of a young boy instead of the city&#039;s mayor, and is unjustly demoted as a result; he then becomes suspect for murder when the department director and several prominent doctors are killed weeks later. It is only after nine years that Dr. Tenma learns the perpetrator of the hospital murders is none other than the boy he saved years before, Johan Liebert. Plagued by guilt, he resolves to find Johan and end the life of this &quot;monster&quot; he feels responsible for creating. Despite his mission, Dr. Tenma is a humanitarian who genuinely cares about the lives of others. These acts of kindness make him very influential with the people he meets.",

He has been called a monster, the next Adolf Hitler and even the devil himself. Johan Liebert was shot in the head at a young age but saved from death by Dr. Tenma. Because of this, he regards Dr. Tenma almost as though he was his father. He has spent portions of his life in different places under different aliases and possesses an extraordinary level of charisma and intelligence. He uses his gifts to cruelly manipulate and corrupt others, often with no apparent end other than to cause suffering and destruction. His goal, as he stated when he was young, is to be the last one standing at the end of the world. One of the themes of Monster is how individuals are capable of transforming into monsters; Johan often acts as both a direct and indirect catalyst for this transformation.\n~! During his \"perfect suicide\" he was shot in the head by a bystander and seemingly died, but was later saved by Kenzo Tenma !~",

Herbert heard the guests inside, talking about how he is suspicious, however guys just laughed at that fact and said that he has no guts to fire a gun and that he is just a cowardly drunk. Those comments made Herbert provoked and he noticed an elderly couple, offering him a gun (a couple was ordered by Johan to give guns to the certain people in the town). He rushed into a bar, but when he arrived, everyone was already dead. He had felt that the \"devil\" has come to the town to destroy it. ~! He was the one who shot Johan Liebert at the end. Herbert later described him as a \"monster with seven heads and many horns\"  who was threatening his son. He was later taken to the police for the further questioning. !~",
