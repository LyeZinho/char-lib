Bam entered in search of his best friend Rachel, and after passing Headon's test he was deemed worthy to climb the Tower.\n\nIn Part I, he is a highly empathetic and caring young man, understanding little of life, having had virtually no contact with people before meeting Rachel and later entering the Tower. He hates loneliness and other people's loneliness. He is considered very naive and knows little about the Tower. During Part I, his only reason for climbing the Tower is to be with Rachel.\n\nIn Part II:\n~!\nHe was forced to join FUG, and received then the name of Jue Viole Grace (쥬 비올레 그레이스), the Slayer Candidate, to keep his real identity hidden. As Viole, he is far more violent. He now has friends to protect and will not hesitate to fight if it means protecting them. He now completely understands that in order to climb the Tower, he must be pre-emptive and prepared to engage in combat and eradicate all opposition. He's become more introverted, rarely ever speaking or displaying any signs of emotion. He's also quite cold and calculating, interacting with others only out of necessity and will take advantage of a situation to defeat his opponents.\n\nLater in the Part as FUG's hold on him weakens, he begins to be more expressive and talkative. Later, when he officially meets with Khun and Rak for the first time in seven years, he smiles happily and embraces them, showing that his original personality that he had hidden away to protect himself from FUG's influence was resurfacing.\n!~\n\nIn Part III:\n~!\nHe is completely back to his normal self, with the addition of some improvements in areas such as confidence. He additionally dropped the 'Viole' look and sticks with an updated 'Baam' look. He is still often called both Baam and Viole now. He now goes through new questions such as what to do when he can't save everyone, and old questions, such as why everyone can't just get along, but he is more accepting of things than before, all the while continually fighting stronger enemies and becoming stronger.\n!~",
