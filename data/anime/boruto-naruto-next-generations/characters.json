      "description": "Boruto Uzumaki is a shinobi from Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan and a direct descendant of the Hyūga clan through his [mother.](https://anilist.co/character/1555/Hinata-Hyuuga) While initially resentful of his [father](https://anilist.co/character/17/Naruto-Uzumaki) and his absence since becoming Hokage, Boruto eventually comes to respect his father and duties. Regardless, he vows to instead become a shinobi like his [mentor.](https://anilist.co/character/13/Sasuke-Uchiha)\n\nBoruto is loud, energetic, and stubborn not unlike his father; even possessing a verbal tic, \"dattebasa\" (だってばさ), similar to Naruto's \"dattebayo\" and his paternal [grandmother's](https://anilist.co/character/7302/Kushina-Uzumaki) \"(da)ttebane\" ((だ)ってばね). However, compared to his father at his age, Boruto is more refined and crafty, seemingly knowing all the shortcuts, as well as more mature in knowing how the world works. Between the two, he is more sarcastic. Unlike Naruto, Boruto doesn't yell what he feels, which is the biggest difference. Despite his laid-back attitude, he is very diligent. Conversely, Boruto's upbringing has also been different than that of his father's: Boruto's family is always there for him, and he likewise has many friends, and his acquisitions came easily and naturally to him from a combination of prodigious talents and nurturing parents.  \n\nSimilar to that of their parents, Boruto shares a complicated relationship with Sasuke's daughter, [Sarada.](https://anilist.co/character/121440/Sarada-Uchiha) The two are often at odds, with the young Uchiha valuing the Hokage post while Boruto was showing utter disdain for it. Despite that, Boruto cares for Sarada and her dream, as witnessed during the Chūnin Exams, when he voiced his desire to win to not diminish Sarada's progress to becoming Hokage.",

After meeting him with the help of [Naruto Uzumaki](https://anilist.co/character/17/Naruto-Uzumaki), Sarada comes to believe that she is defined by the connections she has with others, and as a member of [Team Konohamaru](https://anilist.co/character/3889/Konohamaru-Sarutobi), she seeks to someday become Hokage so that she can connect with as many people as possible.\n\nHowever, Sarada shares a complicated relationship with Naruto's son, [Boruto Uzumaki](https://anilist.co/character/121439/Boruto-Uzumaki), although she is also interested in him due to their similar relationships with their respective fathers.

      "description": "Mitsuki was created as a synthetic human by [Orochimaru,](https://anilist.co/character/2455/Orochimaru) being cultivated from the same embryo as at least one older \"Mitsuki\". Just like his \"brother\", Mitsuki was named after \"Tsuki\" (杯, Literally meaning: Vessel) and the sixth sign of the Chinese zodiac calendar, \"Mi\" (巳, Literally meaning: Snake). Orochimaru, as Mitsuki's \"parent\", wanted Mitsuki to find his independence, having concocted a complex plot for Mitsuki to do so. On Orochimaru's sixth attempt of the plan, each time erasing Mitsuki's memories of the previous, Mitsuki mastered Sage Transformation and decided to rebel against his \"parent\" and \"older brother\". He left their company and set out to forge his own destiny himself, now going by the name \"Mitsuki\" (巳月, Mitsuki) by replacing the second character with \"Tsuki\" (月, Literally meaning: Moon). Upon discovering the existence of [Boruto Uzumaki](https://anilist.co/character/121439/Boruto-Uzumaki) via a gift from Orochimaru, Mitsuki decided to go to Konoha and befriend him in order to find his own path in life. \n\nMitsuki has a very calm and matter-of-fact demeanor. He is generally seen very cheerful, if not indifferent, the situation at hand. While not confrontational, he freely speaks his mind in any situation and does things at his own pace. He is also shown to have a sharp wit, being well-read and observant, showing advanced knowledge in mathematics. He's quite close with Boruto, caring about his opinion above that of most others. Seemingly stemming from his harsh upbringing with Orochimaru, Mitsuki is very vicious in battle, showing no restraint and willing to kill his foes without hesitation. He is also very driven and committed when given a task, as when he was ordered to kill someone, he would not waiver regardless of who it is. During his time at the Academy, it doesn't seem as though he had much of a friendship with [Sarada Uchiha](https://anilist.co/character/121440/Sarada-Uchiha) until they were assigned to Team [Konohamaru.](https://anilist.co/character/3889/Konohamaru-Sarutobi)\n\nDespite not revealing much about his origins or parents to them, Mitsuki cares about his teammates, Boruto and Sarada, to the point where he never hesitates to rush to their side when they are in danger or in need of assistance. Mitsuki has a high opinion of Boruto as the son of the [Seventh Hokage](https://anilist.co/character/17/Naruto-Uzumaki) and the grandson of the [Fourth Hokage,](https://anilist.co/character/2535/Minato-Namikaze) and Mitsuki believes Boruto is destined to become Hokage himself one day, despite hearing Sarada's repeated declarations that she will be Hokage.  \n\nMitsuki seems to admire Naruto and Sasuke Uchiha due to them both being high-ranked shinobi and tells Boruto and Sarada how his parent told him their fathers are rivals who can fight equally. Mitsuki also holds a great deal of admiration for his father as well as confidence in his abilities, to the point of being naive, as shown when he boasted to Boruto and Sarada that Orochimaru was even more powerful than both of their fathers. \n\n(Source: Boruto Wiki)",

When born, a powerful [nine-tailed demon fox](https://anilist.co/character/7407) attacked his village. With a wave of its tail, the demon fox could raise tsunamis and shatter mountains. In a valiant attempt to save the village from destruction, the Fourth Hokage and leader of the Hidden Leaf Village sealed the demon fox within Naruto's newborn body. This was his final act, for the battle with the fox cost him his life.  Despite the Fourth Hokage's dying wish that Naruto is viewed as a hero for serving as the container for the demon (a  _Jinchuuriki_), the adult villagers of Konoha harbored a fierce hatred for him, with many believing that Naruto and the demons were one and the same. Cast aside as an inhuman monster, Naruto was outcast and ostracised by the villagers for reasons he could not understand. The children his age could only ever follow their parents' example; and they too came to harbor a fierce hatred for Naruto.  Naruto eventually came to accept that he would live and die alone, and his external response was to perform harmless pranks on the village. Coy, raffish, and full of life, Naruto soon came to display a somewhat unexpected determination to succeed and be accepted by others. Upon being assigned to \"Team Seven\" as a Genin-ranked ninja, his true potential soon became outwardly apparent.  Vowing to become Hokage one day and using his will to never give in, Naruto saves the village from invading forces and earns his acceptance. Eventually, Naruto learns to harness the power of the Demon Fox sealed inside him to perform acts of strength far beyond what any other human is capable of.  In all, Naruto is an admirable character whose sheer determination to succeed despite the odds, earns him respect and devotion from his fellow villagers.",

Anko was once the student of Orochimaru. Later she, along with nine others, were branded with Orochimaru&#039;s first ten samples of the Cursed Seal of Heaven. Of the ten, Anko was the only one to survive, establishing the one-in-ten chance of surviving the Cursed Seal. Orochimaru supposedly rejected Anko as a subordinate, believing she did not have the lust for power or vengeance needed to fuel the Cursed Seal. Orochimaru lost interest in her, though he believed there was some value in letting her live. In the anime, after learning of her past, she was glad to discover that she wasn&#039;t tossed away like trash as she first had thought by Orochimaru, but chose to leave Orochimaru herself.    Anko is easygoing, tomboyish, playful, stubborn, and sometimes hyperactive, making her very similar to Naruto Uzumaki in many ways. Despite portraying several &quot;Naruto-like&quot; habits, she has shown to be very knowledgeable and studious.     However, she is also shown to have a bloodthirsty (in a literal sense) side, as shown when she scratched Naruto&#039;s face with a kunai, and licked away his blood. This probably comes from her time with Orochimaru. She regularly makes sure to have at least basic knowledge of the landscape for which her next mission will take place. As shown in flashbacks during the Land of Sea arc, Anko greatly admired Orochimaru while under his tutelage, seeing him as a role model and was inspired to be more like him. After being branded by Orochimaru with the Curse Seal, Anko became enraged and carried a deep loathing for her former teacher. From there on, Anko continues to search for Orochimaru in hopes of taking him down, feeling that it is her duty as his former subordinate to stop him, even at the cost of her life.",

      "description": "__Height__: 147.3 cm-148.3 cm (I); 160 cm (II)  \n__Ninja Registration Nº__: 012612  \n__Rank__: Genin (I); Chuunin (II)  \n__Likes__: Naruto, zenzai(sweet red-bean soup), cinnamon rolls, pressing flowers  \n__Dislikes__: Crab, shrimp  \n\nHyuuga Hinata is the eldest daughter of the Hyuga clan's main branch. \"Hyuga\" (日向) means \"toward the sun\" while \"Hinata\" is a pun, as it is another way to read this kanji and means \"a sunny place\". Hinata was trained by her father, Hiashi Hyuga, to become the clan's heiress, though in time he came to deem her a lost cause. Believing her to be of lesser skill than her younger sister, Hanabi Hyuga, her father left Hinata in Kurenai Yuhi's care once she was assigned to Team 8, claiming he didn't care what happened to her. Throughout her early time in Team 8, Hinata's lack of self-confidence and unwillingness to fight hamper her abilities. Although she would train to improve her skills, she would immediately give up when faced with competition and failed every mission she was assigned as a result.  In an attempt to change herself, Hinata enters the Chunin Exams, where she is pit against her cousin, Neji Hyuga, in the exam's preliminary matches. Neji is quick to ridicule Hinata for her personality traits and attempts to convince her that she is a failure who will never be able to change herself, bringing her to tears. Naruto Uzumaki's encouragement, however, empowers her to fight her cousin despite repeatedly being struck down. Although she is defeated, Naruto's words have a lasting effect on Hinata and she becomes more confident in her abilities, and even sticks up for herself by telling Neji that he is the one who is attempting to fight against what cannot be changed. After recovering from her wounds, Hinata continues training to prove herself to her father and Naruto. Her efforts are successful in both regards, as she is eventually able to acquire a better relationship with her father, who encourages her to continue working on improving herself. Naruto has also come to hold her in a higher standing, and he tells her that while he had considered her timid and weird before, he now views her as a likable person.  Hinata has a long-standing crush on Naruto, which has been present since their time in the Academy. Her feelings for him are rooted in his determination, confidence, and strength, all of which Hinata lacks. With her affection for Naruto, Hinata is constantly willing to break away from her normal personality traits in order to help him. She also becomes more assertive for Naruto, and also doesn't hesitate to defend him, even to himself. Her feelings for Naruto are one of the driving forces in her self-improvement, as she tries to gain strength in an attempt to both impress him and become like him. When they meet again in Part II, Hinata is unable to bring herself to greet Naruto and passes out when he comes to greet her, her feelings for him having apparently been amplified during his absence. Despite this, she gradually becomes more comfortable around Naruto, going from being unable to look him in the eye to being able to talk to him, and is able to work with him without difficulty when they are on missions together.  As a member of the Hyuga clan, Hinata possesses the Byakugan, which gives her an almost 360 field of vision. During the Chunin Exams, she displays the ability to focus the Byakugan's sight, increasing the distance that her eyes can see. She also specializes in the Gentle Fist fighting style, which allows her to damage her opponent's chakra circulatory system and inner organs directly with even a slight tap. In her quest to get stronger, Hinata creates a new ability during the anime's Bikochu arc called Protection of the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms (守護八卦六十四掌, Shugohakke Rokujūyon Shō?), a combination of the Hyuga clan's most powerful techniques. With it Hinata emits streams of chakra from her palms to create extremely sharp blades that she can use to hit any target in her field of vision. Due to the speed at which these blades move, the amount of control she has over them, as well as her ability to manipulate their size, Hinata can use this technique to attack and defend simultaneously.",

      "description": "__Height:__ 146 cm\n\nGaara was introduced in the series in Chuunin Exams arc, as a violent shinobi from Konoha's allied country, the Wind country. He came to Konoha with his siblings Temari and Kankuro, and with his mentor Baki, to participate in Chuunin exams.  From the first look, he was shown as merciless and violent individual. Due to his hard childhood, and lack of love, Gaara grew up hating everybody around him, loving only himself.   In fateful incident about 6 years before the main story time, he made himself a tattoo of Japanese Kanji letter \"Ai\", which stands for \"Love\". In Gaara's case, that Love was for himself, as he was \"Demon loving only himself\".  Gaara's point of view dramatically changed after a clash with Naruto, who taught him the true meaning of loving others. Since then, Gaara always feels in debt to Naruto, and tries to help him as much as he can.  Like Naruto, Gaara is a Jinchuuriki who holds within him the one tailed beast, Ichibi no Shukaku. Gaara also relates to Naruto in that in his early years, Gaara was often repelled by other children, and feared by Suna's citizens due to the incredible power he possessed.",

He tries to seem more caring by smiling, though his teammates come to dislike it due to his obvious insincerity. \n\nSai is a talented artist, and claims to have drawn thousands of pictures.

      "description": "Suigetsu Hozuki is a former experimental subject of Orochimaru. Suigetsu once trained to be one of the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist, and as such has a number of traits consistent with other known members. In addition to having shark-like teeth, Suigetsu enjoys killing; Kisame Hoshigaki, one of the Seven Swordsmen, claims Suigetsu is a prodigy at the art of murder, as he has a habit of chopping off his victim's limbs before beheading them. He is also very confident in his abilities, since he has threatened Sasuke Uchiha on more than one occasion. Not afraid to speak his mind and always doing as he pleases, Suigetsu clashed with Sasuke at first, but eventually came to accept Sasuke's position and even put himself in harm's way to protect him.   After joining Hebi, Sasuke takes Suigetsu to retrieve Zabuza Momochi's giant Kubikiri Hōchō from his graveside. Suigetsu can wield the weapon with relative ease, despite its enormous size and weight. In his allegiance with Sasuke, Suigetsu hopes to acquire the sword of Kisame as well, which Karin assumes to mean that he wants to collect all of the swords of the Seven Swordsmen.  Suigetsu is able to reduce himself to liquid form and return to bodily form at will. This ability also allows him to change his body shape, giving him the ability to increase the size of his limbs, proportionally increasing his strength, if necessary. It also makes striking him somewhat difficult; since he is made of liquid, any sufficiently powerful strike will go right through his watery form. Suigetsu is the first ninja seen carrying water bottles on his outfit. Given his somewhat frequent desire to consume water, it is suggested that Suigetsu requires regular hydration to sustain his watery form.",
