She can speak multiple languages and can stay calm in stressful situations.\n\n~!Cynthia worked at a café as a young woman. A regular at the café, Thomas Meyer, asked if he could paint her likeness. They hit it off and soon started dating and living together (where they ate many meals of canned beans). Both were trying to hit it big in their careers, Cynthia with acting and Thomas with painting. Their bond grew greater through their time together, and Thomas proposed to Cynthia with a ring he drew. Cynthia accepts his proposal and their relationship is at its peak with the engagement. \n\nOne day while trying to sell his paintings Thomas was noticed by James Coleman. Thomas was hired by Coleman to make counterfeit paintings to sell at his art auctions. During this time, Cynthia and Thomas grew apart due to Thomas's focus on money and his contract with Coleman. Some time after her breakup with Thomas, Cynthia met Laurent and became a con-artist.!~\n\n~!During the team's Con in London, Laurent makes sure Cynthia can get her revenge against Coleman and patch things up Thomas. After the success of the Con, due to Thomas painting one last forgery, he and Cynthia have a chat and amicably part ways after.!~",
