  "description": "This romantic comedy revolves around an antisocial high school student named Hikigaya Hachiman with a distorted view on life and no friends or girlfriend. When he sees his classmates talking excitedly about living their adolescent lives, he mutters: \"They're a bunch of liars.\" When he is asked about his future dreams, he responds: \"Not working.\" A teacher gets Hachiman to join the 'Volunteer Service' club, which happens to have the school's prettiest girl: Yukinoshita Yukino.\n\n(Source: Anime News Network)",
