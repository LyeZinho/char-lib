She wears the Platelet uniform and is always seen working with her fellow workers.\n\nPlatelets play an important role in healing the body. They are powerless against threats; however, they are small and nimble thus able to move through bacterium under the protection of white blood cells to cover up wounds. Platelets also can aggregate together to close an open wound. They use a protein known as \"Von Willebrand Factor\" to help them, which functions similar to super-glue. Then, the \"Coagulation Factors\" in the blood will work to coat the blot with a net of Fibrin, causing it to solidify. She has a polite, bouncy personality that manifests a strong leadership to other Platelets. Her innocent and humble character made her loveable to other cells.",
