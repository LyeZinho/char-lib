      "description": "__Height:__ 195 cm (6'5\")\n__Race:__ Human (formerly), Vampire (onwards)\n__Nationality:__ British\n\nDio is an immortal vampire and the arch rival of the Joestar clan.\n \n__Series 1: Phantom Blood__ \n~!Dio is the son of Dario Brando, an alcoholic and abusive father. Back when Dio was just a boy, he was brought into the household of George Joestar after the mysterious death of his father, so as to repay the debt he owed Dio's father for saving his life. But soon Dio's personality caused trouble for George's young son, Jonathan Joestar. Even more of a sociopath than his father, Dio was resolute to shatter Jonathan's spirit and take his place as the favored son, even going so far as to arrange for Jonathan's dog Danny to be burned to death. Initially, Dio is able earn the trust of the patriarch of the Joestar family through deceit (and at Jonathan's expense). However, his plans of taking over the Joestar household were discovered by Jonathan when he discovered that not only had Dio poisoned his biological father to death, he was doing the same to his adoptive father, all to take the Joestar estate for his own.  Determined not to be stopped, and understanding the potential to enjoy power over all things instead of just the Joestar estate, Dio wears and activates the Stone Mask, becoming a nearly unstoppable vampire. His gains supernatural abilities such as being able to walk on walls, and regenerating his body faster than fire can consume it. He is able to create two fluid jets from his eyes powerful enough to slice stone and kill living things. He is also able to vaporize his body fluid rapidly enough to freeze anything he touches. However, this is at the expense of having his body be sustained by sheer willpower alone, rather than vital energy. A sufficiently powerful vital force--specifically, sunlight or the Hamon force--will negate the sustaining force's presence and disintegrate the long-unliving body. Like all Jojo vampires, Dio sucks blood through tentacles in his fingers and has been seen at least once drinking blood from an unnamed girl.  At the end of Series 1, Dio's body was destroyed, but his severed head managed to kill Jonathan Joestar and together they sank to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.!~ \n\n__Series 3: Stardust Crusaders__ \n~!100 years later, at the bottom of the sea, Dio's severed head reattached itself to Jonathan Joestar's lifeless body (giving Dio the same star birthmark as the members of the Joestar family). Dio's casket is recovered by fishermen, who are implied to have been killed by Dio as he awakened. He finds that he is now in the year 1985. After he returns to land he develops a Stand (a sort of ghostly bodyguard), giving him vastly powerful new abilities on top of his vampiric powers. For most of Series 3, Dio is out of scene and in the shadows, and the question of exactly what his Stand \"The World\" can do is a mystery.  In Series 3, many of Dio's offensive vampiric abilities do not appear, though he displays a new ability described as \"evil implants\"; parasites generated in his hair that attach themselves to and brainwash victims, finding early success with Kakyoin and Polnareff. Dio's Stand \"The World\", as a sort of brother power to \"Star Platinum\", possesses great speed and strength and, crucially, is able to stop time, making Dio appear to teleport or move at impossible speed. Dio's ambition is to create a perfect world for himself and his servants. In the interim, he seeks to drain for himself the blood of the Joestar lineage, which will help him to fully fuse with Jonathan Joestar's body and take better control of The World. Once he does this, his powers will gradually increase, until he is able to stop time for as long as he likes. In the beginning of the story arc Dio's World, Dio mainly battles Kakyoin and Joseph. Kakyoin succeeds in leading Dio into a vast barrier created by his Stand, trapping him. Dio uses The World to stop time, allowing him to ignore the barrier and approach Kakyoin to deliver a fatal blow. Before dying, Kakyoin deduces the The World's time-stop ability and uses his last strength to give Joseph this message. Joseph then warns this to Jotaro before he is also killed by Dio.  After a long battle between Dio and Jotaro, Jotaro finds his own ability to stop time just before Dio drops a steamroller on him, proceeding in time-stop to break Dio's leg. Jotaro's intention was for the two to end the fight with a final blow once Dio's leg had healed. Dio, determined not to lose, squirts blood from his open leg into Jotaro's eyes. Dio then attempts a final kick with The World, which Jotaro blindly counters with a punch from Star Platinum. Star Platinum's hand breaks on The World's leg, but the punch sends a fissure through The World and through Dio, shattering Dio completely above the waist. Jotaro and doctors from the Speedwagon Foundation (an oil and medicine company loyal to the Joestar family) transfer the blood from Dio's lower half to Joseph Joestar, reviving him. Later, they lay Dio Brando's remains in the Sahara Desert to evaporate with the rising sun.!~ \n\n__Series 6: Stone Ocean__ \n~!In Part 6, it is revealed to the Joestars that his reemergence was planned to create a perfect world when the moon reached a certain angle and time. He stumbled upon Enrico Pucci not long before Part 3 and \"healed\" his disfigured foot for him. After piercing Pucci with a Stand arrow, the two spent considerable time together, plotting and scheming. He questioned Pucci's loyalty to him, wondering why he didn't use Whitesnake to remove The World from him. Pucci had explained that he loved Dio as he had loved God, and thus worshipped him too much to betray him. Ensuring that he wouldn't completely fade, he left one of his bones in Pucci's care. Dio's presence continues to haunt the series, emerging in flashbacks and his disfigured sons. His bone played a vital plot element for the first half of Part 6, an odd green baby inheriting a Stand to merge with it.!~",

      "description": "ACDC is one of the Pillar Men that were discovered by Nazis in Rome. Like Wham and Cars, ACDC is very confident in his powers and abilities and see humans as inferior. However, he has a more violent temper than the others to the point that he has to cry and sob to calm himself down.  He is named after Australian Hard rock band AC/DC.   ~!ACDC uses \"the skill of fire\". He raises his body temperature in order to heat his blood to 500°C. He then extends his blood vessels out of his body and makes them into long, prehensile needles with which he injects his hot blood into enemies, dissolving them from within. Even if the blood isn't injected directly, it can still eat through flesh and metal alike if sprayed on a target from the outside. AC/DC has been shown to have an extremely erratic temper, sobbing at the sight of his own severed arm, only to calm himself near-instantly and replace it with the arm of Loggins. He himself stated that he has a more explosive temper than either of his brethren, and claims to openly express any rage or sorrow he feels so he doesn't lose his self-control.  ACDC had traveled to ancient China and knew Sun Tzu's theory that \"all warfare is based on deception\". In his battle with Joseph Joestar, he tries to intimidate him by disabling Joseph's deceptive tactics.  ACDC cuts the hidden rope through which Joseph plans to send Ripple energy to hurt him. Nevertheless, he falls for Joseph's more sophisticated deception, for Joseph has predicted his action and employed the cut-and-restore rope trick on the rope.  His bones and muscles are destroyed, but his brain and blood vessels possess Suzi Q, who takes the Red Stone of Aja and sends it to Cars in Switzerland. ACDC then prepares to turn Suzi Q into a \"blood bomb\", planning on pressurizing his boiling blood until her body bursts, killing himself and Joseph's group in the process. Joseph and Caesar attack Suzi Q at the same time. While their Ripples cancel each other out and keep Suzi Q unharmed, ACDC is destroyed.!~ (Source: Wikipedia)",

He is a very strong and honorable warrior who possess the power of the wind, and also reflexively attacks anyone who steps on his shadow. If he goes blind, he can grow a horn on his forehead and sense sound waves with it. He can also draw air into his body and blast it through the tip of the horn, creating a highly-destructive \"wind scalpel\". He is also extremely honorable, stopping himself from defeating a defenseless Joseph Joestar when he said that with a month to train he could beat Wham.    ~!Later on, he engaged in battle with Caesar Anthonio Zeppeli and killed him, but not before he managed to rip off Wham's lip piercing containing the poison within Joseph. In another display of honor, Wham allowed the antidote to stay where Joseph could get it out of respect for Caesar's valiant effort. Later challenging Wham to battle to avenge Caesar, they engaged in a deadly Roman chariot race, with Wham initially getting the upper hand. After Joseph managed to counter Wham's wind scalpel, he was left as nothing more than a head with the Ripple energy slowly killing him. After Joseph gave Wham some of his own blood to ease his pain, he used the last of is strength to destroy a group of vampires that attempted to kill Joseph. Wham then vanished in a gust of wind, with Joseph giving an unconscious salute to him.!~ He is named after the 80s duo featuring George Michael, Wham!.  (Source: Wikipedia)",

Strangely, despite his apathy towards humans and willingness to kill them, he has been shown to be more compassionate for other living beings. In Switzerland, he sliced a car that was about to hit a puppy in half, and later on maneuvered himself during a long fall to miss a patch of flowers near the bottom of the cliff. Cars' power is that of light; he is able to produce bladed appendages from his arms and use these to reflect blinding light toward his enemies. He also has the same powers over his body that all the Pillar Men share.    ~!When he gains the power of the stone mask, he becomes invulnerable to sunlight, and also gains some abilities on a genetic level; he can produce living creatures and control them, and can mutate his body into various forms. He outlasts his comrades and eventually does gain almost unlimited power as the ultimate \"evolved\" man through the Red Stone of Aja and a stone mask. In a final confrontation, he succeeds in severing Joseph's hand but is eventually blown into space by a volcanic eruption as well as an ultimate Ripple attack from Joseph. Being immortal, he does not die; however he is unable to return to Earth after being thrown out of orbit. Trapped in the void of space for eternity, he eventually stops thinking and desires death.!~ He is named after the 80's new wave group The Cars.  (Source: Wikipedia)",

Wang Chang sold Dio the poison which Dio used in his murder of Dario Brando and his attempted murder of George Joestar, although Wang was not concerned with what the poison was to be used for. He told Dio, without much, if any, intent to provoke him, of a man in his own land who had a similar birthmark to Dio's who had had a harsh life, but in the end lived to be over 183.   Sometime after, he was was captured by Jonathan Joestar and taken to the the Joestar Manor. When he is used in an attempt to force Dio to go with the police, he again mentions his fortune telling, saying that Dio is far too lucky to fully have to give up this early. Dio uses George's blood to become a vampire, taking Wang Chan as his subordinate when the latter goes to search the Joestar manor for valuables.   Dio trusts him enough to be responsible for his head and implanting it onto Jonathan's body. This did not go according to plan, however as Jonathan use the last of his strength to crush Wang Chan's head and sent a ripple to take control of his body, and made him sink the ship of zombies by grinding his body into the machinery.",
