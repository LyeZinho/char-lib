When she was two, her mother began her last dive to the bottom of the abyss. She was left under the care of the Belchero Orphanage. Her dream is to become a White Whistle, a legendary type of  Delver, and explore the depths of the abyss to learn its many secrets and find her mother.\n\nRiko is a good-natured, joyful, and energetic child. She has a quick and inquisitive mind, gathering and properly organizing all the information available on subjects that interest her. Growing up, she diligently studied to become a Delver like her mother was, enchanted by its mysteries and secrets. By the age of twelve, she had become an Apprentice Delver with the right to explore the shallowest level of the abyss on her own. Compared to [Reg](https://anilist.co/character/122444/Reg), she is fragile and lacking in physical prowess. However, her ability to keep a cool head under pressure to make rational decisions allows her to tackle the abyss.",

      "description": "Reg is a robotic being who appears to be a little boy. His actual age, origins, and even name are unknown because he cannot recall anything about his life before his encounter with [Riko](https://anilist.co/character/122443/Riko). He is named after a dog Riko used to have. Having a seemingly artificial body, Reg might be the only being completely immune to the Curse of the Abyss. Because of this, he is sometimes referred to as \"The Treasure of the Deep.\"\n\nReg’s body is extremely durable, even to the point that [Ozen the Immovable](https://anilist.co/character/122464/Ouzen) couldn’t break him even when slamming him into the floor with all her strength. Despite his high durability, Reg is agile and weighs little. His wounds heal at a faster rate than a human’s, and has a very high pain tolerance. His senses of smell and hearing are strong, one comparable to a dog. His arms can extend up to 40 meters each and can shoot them to the top of cliffs or grab things very far away. The cords attached are very durable. He is also equipped with an incinerator, which is a powerful incendiary cannon built into his hands and feet, emitting a beam of light, indicating the area to eliminate, penetrating through objects. Objects within the range of the light break apart and are absorbed into the spinning axes. The incinerator is connected to the Abyss in an unknown way, having the power to rewrite the rules of the Abyss. Reg passes out for 2 hours upon use, but it can be fired multiple times in the 10-minute deadline, and can also be set to not affect living beings.\n\nDespite being a formidable fighter, Reg is rather shy, naive, and unassertive. He blushes easily and often cries when in distress. However, when forced into danger or an unpleasant situation, he is shown to be hot-tempered and sharp, compared to Riko's analytic, noncombatant role. Regardless of his skittishness, Reg has made it his sworn duty to protect Riko and doesn't hesitate to put up a fight when she is in harm's way. According to Ozen, the way he speaks and handles his body is similar to [Lyza](https://anilist.co/character/122465/Lyza). One of his favorite words to say is \"irredeemable,\" which was a word that Lyza often said.",

Though how cruel, he still cared for the kids and people he brutally experimented on.\n\nHis methods went against all the ethical principles of delvers, but he was allowed to continue due to his outstanding results. Ten years ago, he did the unthinkable by establishing a large base named the Idofront in the deepest area within the 5th Layer of the Abyss, as well as securing a route to the then-inviolable 6th layer.\n\n~!During one of his experiments researching the Curse of the Abyss, Bondrewd offered children who wanted to unravel the secrets of the Abyss to come with him to the Ido Front. However, he never told them openly that they were going to be used as test subjects. Among the children were Nanachi and Mitty. As Bondrewd continued testing, more and more children were used up in his experiments until only Nanachi and Mitty were left. On his final test, he used both of them, resulting in Mitty being hit with the Curse of the Abyss, while Nanachi received the Blessing.!~",
