She is a bloom, which is considered the upper class. She was appointed as the freshmen representative, and is well known throughout the school.  Described as very beautiful, she draws attention everywhere she goes. Yet, she is still modest and kind. \n\nShe has a warm and loving nature, and defends her brother readily. She feels bad about being labelled as a \"genius\"; she feels that her brother is the real genius. Miyuki feels sad that their father only cares about her, and ignores Tatsuya completely.",
