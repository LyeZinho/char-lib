He joined the Fire Force to achieve his dream of becoming a hero and saving people from the fear of the flames, as well as uncover the truth behind his family's death twelve years ago.\n\nThough a newcomer in the Special Fire Force, Shinra has posed a challenge to experienced members of the force and has even defeated a Captain. Being a Fire Soldier, Shinra is experienced in rescuing people and is strong enough to carry four people out of a building. While he mostly relies on his Ignition Ability in combat, he has exhibited skill in ordinary fighting as well, being able to pin an opponent to the ground and break their guard with a sturdy kick, as well as being capable of defending himself from ground-breaking attacks.",

      "description": "__Height:__ 189 cm (6'2\")\n__Affiliation:__ Special Fire Force Company 8\n__Rank:__ Captain\n\nThe popular and charismatic leader of the newly established Company 8. His goal is to investigate the other companies and uncover the truth about spontaneous human combustion. He has no powers, but uses his finely-honed muscles as a weapon in a battle style that's on even par with Benimaru's. Loves bodybuilding to an almost creepy extent.\n\nDespite not being a Pyrokinetic like most other known Battalion Commanders, Akitaru has a very fit physique, which allows him to face Infernals. In battle, he is seen using different weapons, suitable for the situation, like the Core Annihilating Pile Bunker or a fire fighting axe, which he can veil in white steam and thrust at the opponent. His weapons appear to be designed in order to impale an Infernal's core with low difficulty. He is able to carry up to 30kg of equipment each time he is on a mission to fight an Infernal. As a fire fighter, Akitaru was recognized enough to be decorated twice, though both were revoked due to actions prioritising saving citizens lives at the expense of defying orders.\n\n(Source: Fire Force Wikia, Kodansha)",

She's a cool lady but is mad about love stories, and her beauty is overshadowed by her \"head full of flowers and wedding bells\". She's friendly but goes berserk when anyone comments on her muscles. Apparently,​ she used to be slender.\n\nMaki possesses Second Generation abilities, having adapted to Spontaneous Human Combustion by becoming able to control flames from a long distance. In doing so, she can handle herself against two Third Generations simultaneously, being able to extinguish and absorb their generated flames into a giant fireball. Maki's abilities provide defense for her entire team, as she can reflect incoming fire attacks and use an opponent's flames against them. While she is unable to deflect or redirect a fire with too much driving force, she is still able to alter its shape in order to reduce its impact.\n\n(Source: Kodansha USA)",

He helped Obi to found Company 8. He never allows the soldiers to play with fire. The gun he uses is a cherished memento from his friend who became an Infernal.\n\nTakehisa is a Second Generation, who has awakened the ability to manipulate flames through the use of firearms, such as a machine gun or a pistol, which he wields on the battlefield. Takehisa's ability allows him to control the gunpowder inside bullets, making the impact they make stronger or weaker, depending on the situation. He can use this ability to make his bullets non-lethal.\n\n(Source: Fire Force Wikia, Kodansha)",

Using it, he can deflect and fend off against flames.\n\n(Source: Fire Force Wikia, Kodansha)",

He can use his brigade's matoi as a pole to fly to long-distance areas, and by using his Second Generation ability, can control the flames of other ignited matoi and direct them to a certain place. He can control the direction and speed of bullets in the same fashion as Takehisa. He is also capable of unleashing an immensely powerful blast that resembles a crimson-coloured moon, which is strong enough to kill a Demon Infernal.\n\nBenimaru is a practitioner of the iaido martial arts.
