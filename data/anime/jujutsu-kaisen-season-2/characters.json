Sorcerers of the era gave their all to defeat him, but to no avail. Without ever being defeated, his body was split into 20 separate indestructible cursed objects, which allowed him to live on and traverse the ages to come. In 2018, Yuuji Itadori consumed one of the aforementioned cursed objects, and Sukuna was reincarnated. \n\n~!In reality, Sukuna was not a demon, but rather a deformed human sorcerer. His body was able to be split up into 20 cursed objects because he received assistance from Kenjaku.!~\n\nSukuna is hedonistic and has no regard for the suffering of others, believing that suffering is natural for the weak. He is selfish, and always wants to stay in control of the situation without caring about the consequences.",
