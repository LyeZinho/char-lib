She is a student at Hyakkaou Private Academy, and a classmate of Yumeko Jabami and Ryota Suzui who is the first character in the entire series that challenges Yumeko and loses against her.\n\nAt first, Mary is shown to be incredibly sadistic and twisted, such as how she treats her classmate Ryota Suzui after he turned into a \"housepet\", due to his low social status within the academy, and is shown cruelly taunting her fellow opponents during their gambling matches. She's also shown to be extremely egotistical both in and out of matches, often being confident in her victory. Mary also possesses a habit of mocking her opponents and laughing at them, especially when match seems to be her win.\n\nAfter losing to Yumeko Jabami and experiencing the life of being a housepet, Mary became desperate to regain her status within the academy, having no other goal in her mind. Soon after being humiliated, Mary eventually loses her pride, having a mental breakdown during a match against Yuriko and falling into the state of grief and shame. After regaining her status, she seems to be no longer this arrogant and cruel, sometimes being only nettled by Ryota's cowardice or Yumeko's reckless behavior, but still deeply caring about them. She also developed a huge hatred towards the student council, wishing them to pay for what they had done to housepets.",
