Despite his murderous intent, his hue has always been pure white.!~   \n\n~!According to Kogami, Makishima's pure Psycho-Pass is the result of having suffered hardships in his early life and that being \"unrecognized\" by Sibyl left Makishima feeling invisible, which may have triggered his single-minded goal of taking down the Sibyl System. Makishima, on the other hand, believes that isolation made him stronger.!~",
