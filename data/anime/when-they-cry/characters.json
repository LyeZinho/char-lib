His charismatic, lively attitude and talented tongue allow him to quickly fit in the town and make new friends and also win some club activities. Though he can be somewhat shy and is easily spooked at times. \n~! In the first couple arcs, paranoia drives him to murder his friends and others, but in the other arcs, he gains inner strength and faith in his friends, enough to change the fate of Hinamizawa, sometimes by remembering the events of Onikakushi-hen.!~ When in need of a weapon, he wields Satoshi's old bat. Keiichi often receives the butt of the jokes in the club's activities from which he was the correct answer to some games they play, to wearing embarrassing costumes whenever he loses punishment games. Keiichi has brown hair with dark blue eyes and is described as charismatic to others.  During his school days, he wears a red shirt under a white one, black pants, a belt, and red shoes. However, during his free days, he wears a black sleeveless shirt under a short red one, green shorts with a blue belt, and shoes.",

She has been the head of the Furude house since her parents died, but rarely attends town meetings due to her young age. While she does not speak a lot, she likes to say nonsense words such as \"mi~\" and \"nipa~\" and often ends her sentences with \"-nano desu\", which inflames Rena's passion for cute things. Despite her young appearance, she is rather calm and reserved-usually serving as the voice of reason amongst the club members. However, she can be calculating if she wishes. \n \n~!It is later revealed that Rika is the \"Queen Carrier\" of the lethal Hinamizawa Syndrome, and in turn keeps the virus under control and prevents it from spreading. Any that leave her presence will exhibit symptoms of the disease, which explains why anyone who leaves Hinamizawa is immediately stricken. According to the late Doctor Takano's research, in the event of Rika's death, within days the entire village of Hinamizawa will fall victim to the disease, and it is also said to spread to neighboring villages if this occurs. For this reason, Rika is sought out and mysteriously murdered in each arc.  She has lived for hundreds of years and she's the only one (together with Hanyuu) who is aware of the time loop, although her friends eventually become aware of their deeds in previous worlds.!~",

Despite her extremely energetic and playful disposition she is actually quite the crybaby, which Mion and Keiichi often tease her about. Satoko is also very close with Rika, who she lives with. \n\n~!Although her personality is quite energetic and mischievous during the events of the games, Satoko's past was full of trauma; her parents died in an accident, she was abused by her foster parents (her aunt and uncle), and her beloved brother Satoshi disappeared. However, in Matsuribayashi-hen, Irie suggested she killed her parents, as she had a bad relationship with them and felt threatened, and so to her it was an act of self-defense. She is suffering from the Hinamizawa Syndrome at that time, and though Takano wanted to disect her alive for study, Irie fought to save her life. She is one of the few characters to ever recover from Level 5 of the Syndrome, but has to take shots on a regular basis. Though she greatly misses Satoshi, and feels that by being strong he will return, she comes to regard Keiichi as her new \"nii-nii\" (a cute term for older brother), and once even regards Shion as \"nee-nee\" (a cute term for older sister).!~  \n\n~!In Gou, it is revealed that like Rika, Satoko has started living in loops in order to get her wish to stay in Hinamizawa with Rika.!~\n\nShe dislikes Japanese pumpkin, and cannot tell the difference between cauliflower and broccoli.",

In spite of their different personalities, she and Mion often switch places, and it can be difficult to distinguish between them. \n\n~!Their first switch took place when they were little. Right before tattooing the symbol of an oni, which is reserved for the older sister, she was mistakenly identified as Shion, the younger sister, which means that she was actually born as Mion Sonozaki, the older sister. Since then, she switched her identity of Mion with Shion, the younger sister. !~  \n\nShe was sent by the Sonozaki family to a private boarding school, but escaped and returned to live near her hometown, where she lives with Kasai. In spite of all this, she and Mion maintain a close relationship. In most of the arcs, she is at a different school from the other main characters, and therefore appears less frequently.  She works as a waitress at the Angel-Mort restaurant and is the manager's assistant for the Hinamizawa Fighters little league team. She is often seen carrying a taser, and also wears yellow ribbon in her hair. She is also shown to be good with guns, along with Kasai, in Matsuribayashi-hen.    \n\n~! She was in love with Satoshi, and blames the Three Families of Hinamizawa for his disappearance in Watanagashi-hen and Meakashi-hen (the latter told from her point of view); this, along with a different demonic sadistic personality she manifested in her grief, drove her to mass murder, which led to psychosis. One of the last words that Satoshi and her exchanged before he disappeared was a promise to take care of Satoko. In Watanagashi-hen and, more explicitly, Meakashi-hen, her resentment toward Satoko for her role in his disappearance causes her to forget this promise and murder her, only to remember too late; however, in subsequent arcs, she has taken the promise to heart to the point were she is willing to give up her life for Satoko.!~",
