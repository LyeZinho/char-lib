She is a clerical employee at the Berlint City Hall. She is soft-spoken and mild-mannered, but has a strong sense of humor. She has a bad drinking habit and falls into a coma when she drinks. At home, she struggles to be a good wife and a kind mother.

In truth, she is an infamous Professional Killer known as \"Thorn Princess\". After becoming overly fixated on the idea her cover might be blown after a coworker ribs her about not being married or even having a boyfriend, Yor suggests to Loid a Marriage of Convenience, which he accepts, as he needs a mother for Anya for his own mission.\n\n~!As of Mission (Chapter) 44, it is revealed that Yor is part of Garden, a powerful paramilitary assassin organization operating within Ostania.!~",
