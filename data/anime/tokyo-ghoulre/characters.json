      "description": "__Height:__ 169 cm (5'6\")\n\nKen Kaneki was originally a human and a normal college student until he encountered a female ghoul named [Rize](https://anilist.co/character/88413/Rize-Kamishiro) who was posing as a human at the time. Rize, using Kaneki's crush on her as leverage, managed to lure him into an alley and tried to eat him but ended up dying when construction beams fell on top of her. Kaneki, already in a half-dead state from Rize's attempts at killing him, ends up in a hospital and has some of Rize's organs transplanted into his body. This results in him absorbing some of Rize's powers and characteristics, such as a ghoul eye, powers of regeneration, and the inability to stomach human food.\n\nTerrified and lost, Kaneki's life takes a dramatic turn from then on as he tries to find a place for himself in the world, realizing he now belongs to neither the human nor ghoul world and refusing to eat humans to sustain himself. Meeting some of the ​other ghouls, as well as humans, makes him realize that things aren't just black and white and that there are more to ghouls and humans than originally thought.",

Tooru is kind with a gentle heart and seems to be shy with little self-confidence. Having a constant case of Anemia, ironically, Mutsuki feels repulsive when he comes into contact with blood. Because of this anxiety, he faces discouragement as a ghoul investigator, to the point where he feels as though he isn’t even needed for the job. He expresses frustration with his own weakness, feeling anger at his lack of ability compared to his comrades. When not working, he is shown to enjoy reading books and is the one often left to relate information to Haise Sasaki. As such, he is shown to be a reliable and hard-working individual, following orders in contrast to the more troublesome or lazy members of his team. Though lacking in confidence, he shows a strong desire to help others and does not hesitate to place himself at risk to protect the innocent.\n\n~!A flashback reveals him to have been born female, but unable to reconcile his feelings of discomfort towards his birth sex.

Shirazu, like most of his teammates, is shown to have great respect for his mentor, Haise Sasaki. However, this doesn’t stop him from going out of his way to execute missions without Sasaki’s permission, and so he is constantly seen accompanying Kuki Urie, the former squad leader, on dangerous assignments. Although he is a competent fighter with a ruthless nature, Urie describes Shirazu as a simple-minded person. \n\nHe also seems to be quite exaggerated in his expressions and movements. His primary motive for joining the Quinx Squad is to get fast money for a purpose unknown at this point in time. Shirazu is also a quite carefree individual, and he seems to have an obsession for exterminating ghouls; both of which are traits that submit to the cocky grin he usually displays.\n\nHe is stated to be poor at tasks that require thought, such as academics or investigation. However, his consideration for others and attention to his surroundings convince Sasaki he has potential as a Squad Leader. In contrast to his loud and violent mannerisms, he is also someone that cares greatly for his team. While prone to bickering with Urie, he shows a gentler side when interacting with Mutsuki or civilians such as Chie",

As a Ghoul Investigator, he appears to be very dedicated and stern about his work, to the point where it may seem as though he is ruthlessly slaughtering more ghouls than necessary, which is a habit he often gets berated for. Urie also tends to be quite hasty when investigating the slightest details or signs of a suspect. He has a tendency to execute mission objectives independently, without awaiting the arrival of his fellow team mates, or even requesting their help. This is because he is an ambitious person, and does not wish to share credit with others, as he merely wishes to achieve higher ranks as a Ghoul Investigator. To achieve his personal goals, he is willing to go as far as manipulating his comrades or causing discord within the team. But beneath his ambition and cool-headed demeanor is an insatiable jealousy towards his superiors, particularly Sasaki. Urie believes that ghouls, under any circumstance, must cease to exist. He is a person who is always striving for power and as a result, constantly looks for ways to one-up everyone around him which is shown by asking Professor Shiba to help augments his kagune's power to presumably to get an edge over Sasaki. \n\nUrie believes that as an investigator, he must never retreat and will fight on even if it means straining himself to the end. This belief stemmed from the fact that his father, a special class investigator in charge of the S3 squad, ordered his team members to retreat while he stayed to fight the One-Eyed Owl to the death. He also holds a grudge against Takeomi Kuroiwa and Iwao, for not fighting by his father's side during the Owl battle; and therefore thinks that they are inconsiderate of his loss. Thus, Urie refuses to forgive them.\n\nAn omake in Volume 1, shows that he is a talented painter.\n\n(Source: Tokyo Ghoul Wikia)",
