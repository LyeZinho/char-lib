This left him with two limitations, the first being that he is not allowed to go against the Hero's orders, with the second being that he is not allowed to lose a fight, otherwise his powers would be returned, never to be given again as predetermined by the Hero's innate skill.!~\n\n__Skills:__\n~!Berserker - An S-ranked skill that increases his magic powers, attacks, defence and endurance at the cost of losing his sense of reason.
