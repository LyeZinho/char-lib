  "description": "In the beginning, an \"orb\" is cast unto Earth. \"It\" can do two things: change into the form of the thing that stimulates \"it\"; and come back to life after death. \"It\" morphs from orb to rock, then to wolf, and finally to boy, but roams about like a newborn who knows nothing. As a boy, \"it\" becomes Fushi.\n\nThrough encounters with human kindness, Fushi not only gains survival skills but grows as a \"person\". But his journey is darkened by the inexplicable and destructive enemy Nokker and cruel partings with the people he loves.\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
