      "description": "__Height:__ 185 cm\n__Nationality:__ Japanese\n\nJosuke is the illegitimate son of Jotaro's grandfather, Joseph Joestar. He is a caring, popular, and slightly naive teenager. Inspired by his police officer grandfather's (on his mother's side) sense of justice, he isn't afraid to fight for those in need. He is confronted by Jotaro with the need to eradicate evil Stand users from his hometown, Morioh. He refuses at first, believing that it is not any of his business. However, he quickly changes his mind when his policeman grandfather is killed by a criminal Stand user. With a vow paralleling that of Peter Parker, Josuke decides to deliver justice to evil Stand users in his grandfather's place.  Josuke is nice to people and says \"Mister\" and \"Miss\" like a normal, polite young man... until someone pisses him off (which isn't very hard to do). The easiest way to do that is to mock his hair, which makes Josuke angry and explosively violent. Josuke grew up with his single mother, never knowing his father Joseph Joestar. Josuke is crafty and has a sneaky streak for money, which is shown multiple times in the story. Nevertheless, he is a dependable and friendly person who is always willing to protect people who need it.\n\nJosuke's Stand power, Crazy Diamond, is a melee Stand with short range (3m). Crazy Diamond has the ability of \"restoration\". It can repair damage (by returning an object to a previous state) and by extension heal injuries (apart from Josuke's own injuries). It is limited in that it cannot revive the dead. It can, however, restore an item to its raw materials (e.g., a table can be restored to timbers). This ability allows Crazy Diamond to perform a range of interesting feats, including trapping the enemy (by restoring pieces of a broken crate around the target) and tracking (e.g., restoring a torn piece of clothing so that it will seek out what it came from and reattach). Its restoration ability often \"malfunctions\" when Josuke is angry, causing the object to be improperly put back together. The Stand's name is a reference to Pink Floyd's song, \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\".",

      "description": "**Height:** 175 cm (5'9\")\n\nKira is a man who longs for a simple life, and doesn't wish to be bothered. Although he reveals many talents, this yearning shows in his dislike of coming in first, as the cast eventually realizes. He becomes quite bothered when someone disrupts his \"simplicity\", and goes to extreme lengths to get it back. He keeps a collection of his own fingernail clippings, and believes when they grow quickly he has trouble. Kira also has a bizarre fetish for the female hand, stemming from an erotic fascination with the hands of the Mona Lisa. Unfortunately, his desire has never extended to the rest of the female person. This results in his murdering women in order to acquire their (severed) hands as \"girlfriends\"—when one \"girlfriend\" begins to decay, he goes off in search of a replacement.  Originally, Kira murdered his victims by stabbing them so viciously they were left with horrific back wounds (their hideous nature is implied by the fact that the reader is never actually shown Reimi's wound). However, his Stand, Killer Queen, eventually awoke from his desire to leave no evidence behind of his killings—hence its ability to make its victims completely disintegrate. He now lets Killer Queen annihilate his victims (except for his \"girlfriend\"-hands), letting everyone else think that the victims have simply gone missing. Even if the number of missing attracts attention (as it eventually does), no one would have any reason to suspect that Kira was involved.",

      "description": "**Height:** 195 cm (6'5\")\n__Occupation:__ Student, Marine Explorer, Oceanographer\n__Nationality:__ Japanese \n\nJoutarou is Holly Kujo's son and Joseph Joestar's grandson. In Part 3, he has a recognizable attire of a blue trenchcoat-length school uniform jacket with yellow chains on the collar. He also wears a trademark hat which, while torn in the back, often seems to blend with his hair. When Joutarou first appears, he turned himself in to the police because he believes his Stand is an evil spirit possessing him. After he is released from jail, and learns what his Stand is, Joutarou gets used to Star Platinum -- a fierce, muscular, vaguely Aztec-looking spirit with \"the precision of a machine\" and the ability to destroy virtually anything with a sledgehammer barrage of fists. He has a very tough exterior, and is even rather rough and delinquent, but he also is very dedicated, intense, and loyal. He is very intelligent, but usually lets his (or Star Platinum's) fists do the talking with the enemy, even though he often has to rely on his wits to deal with stand users' attacks. He is also known for a quick and short temper. His catchphrase is \"Yare yare daze.\" It generally relates of being bored or exasperation. In Part 3, he is the main target of Dio, who realizes that Joutarou is his greatest threat.\n\nOne of the strongest stands in the JoJo universe; Star Platinum possesses super human senses, strength, stamina, accuracy and speed. It can see for great distances and at great magnifications. The Star tarot card that Star Platinum is named after symbolizes hope. Like other physically powerful stands, Star Platinum suffers from a narrow range of activity. It can only be active within a 2-3 meter radius from Joutarou. ~!It is similar to Dio's The World stand, and, it turns out, can likewise be used to stop time, but that ability is only revealed in Joutarou's epic battle with Dio Brando when Dio was about to drop a steamroller on him.!~\n\nIn the sixth story arc Stone Ocean, Joutarou becomes an oceanologist, moves to the United States, eventually marries, and his daughter, Jolyne inherits the potential to wield Stand powers.",
