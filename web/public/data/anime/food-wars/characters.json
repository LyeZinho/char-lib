Because she is intimidated very easily, she makes simple mistakes when she cooks, causing many of her classmates to see her as a weak student. She is quick to panic when something goes awry and tends to over think situations when under pressure or stress, such as repeatedly packing and unpacking a suitcase to make sure she packed something, even though she did not need to pack a suitcase in the first place.\nInitially, she heavily relied on Sōma's creativity to pull them both through tough assignments both in the academy and at the Training Camp.

He is half-Japanese but, unlike his brother Isami, appears more European – with blond hair and blue eyes – and is noted as being extremely handsome, having fan clubs in Tōtsuki Academy and his hometown. He enrolled in Tōtsuki at the behest of his uncle, taking with him his mezzaluna (two-handed knife) and a bottle of homemade olive oil as a good luck charm. His specialty is Italian cuisine, although many professional chefs noted that he has a broad vision; like Sōma, he will incorporate ingredients and methods from other culinary styles to create inventive dishes, and can modify his recipes while cooking. He is very kind and supportive of his less-skilled brother, to the point of risking his pride to defend Isami's honor.\n\nTakumi has a fierce (and somewhat one-sided) rivalry with Sōma. Takumi sees Sōma as someone similar to himself – both having grown-up working at small family restaurants – and a worthy rival, and jumps at any chance to compete with him. He frequently tries to challenge Sōma to informal cooking challenges (usually leading to an embarrassing situation for himself), hoping to one day defeat Sōma in a formal Shokugeki. Despite their rivalry, both he and Sōma greatly respect each other, and likely view each other as friends outside of the arena.\n\nTakumi and his brother Isami are the main characters of the Shokugeki no Soma – Fratelli Aldini spinoff manga which focuses on their time in Italy before going to Tōtsuki Academy.",

He is commonly seen sporting glasses and red hair. Known as the \"Legumes Magician\", Kojirou was convinced he was going to be successful in France with his French–Japanese fusion restaurant, Shino's. However, his French staff refused to follow his recipes, even sabotaging his dishes. Facing financial ruin, he hardened himself emotionally and fired anyone who questioned his skills in the kitchen. Although this allowed him to reach the top, his proud and stubborn refusal to make exceptions resulted in his skills stagnating over the years.\n\n~!Kojirou returns to Toutsuki as a guest teacher, and \"fires\" Megumi for altering his recipe despite there being an insufficient quantity of suitable ingredients. He threatens to do the same to Souma for coming to her defense, leading Souma to challenge him to an unofficial Shokugeki. During this match, Shinomiya makes a technically perfect dish that is the unanimous winner. However, Gin gives a bonus vote for Megumi's dish, prompting Shinomiya to try it and admit that her flexible cooking style suits the tastes of the customer. Shinomiya is reminded of his mother's kindness, and taking this to heart lets Megumi pass.!~\n\n~!Kojirou reappears in the story when Souma is assigned as a stagiaire (intern) at his new restaurant, Shino's Tokyo. His personality has noticeably softened since their last encounter, and he helps Souma by improving the latter's dish which earns a place on his menu. It is revealed during this time that Kojirou chose to specialize in French cuisine in order to make his mother happy.!~\n\nShinomiya Kojirou is the main character of the Shokugeki no Soma – Etoile spinoff manga which focuses on his time in France after he graduates from Toutsuki Academy.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
