Izuku has since become All Might's closest pupil.\n\nIzuku is a very timid, reserved, and polite boy. Although initially portrayed as insecure, tearful, and vulnerable, Izuku gradually matures into a more confident and braver person. His infectious leadership skills, combined with his passion and strategic abilities, have turned Izuku into a central figure of Class 1-A. He is caring and emotional, never hesitating to help or rescue someone in danger, even if he knows that he might not be strong or otherwise qualified enough to do it.\n\nIzuku is extremely (and sometimes scarily) enthusiastic about topics related to heroes. His dream drives him to write down notes about everything he learns about heroes' Quirks and fighting capabilities. Thanks to this practice, Izuku has developed a great analytical mind and can form complex battle plans in a few seconds, factoring in the best ways he can utilize the Quirks of allies and enemies alike for his own advantage.\n\nIzuku's Quirk \"One For All\" was transferred to him from All Might. His Quirk allows him to stockpile an enormous amount of raw power, allowing him to significantly enhance all of his physical abilities to various boundless levels. This results in unbelievable levels of strength, speed, stamina, agility, and durability. Izuku can focus the stockpiled power into a single body part, or spread it across his entire body evenly, though, focusing the power in a single part puts a greater strain on that part of his body.",

Due to a combination of an old theory claiming Quirks derived from rats and his own mysophobia, Overhaul believes that Quirks are actually a plague on humanity, having infected people with \"syndromes\" of heroism and villainy. He looks down upon those that use their abilities for either purpose, referring to acts of heroic sacrifice or petty crime as \"sicknesses\". Overhaul is extremely determined to his ambition of eradicating Quirks, not only due to his own personal phobias, but also because such a thing would allow the yakuza to reclaim the power they once held over society. \n\nKai's Quirk \"Overhaul\" grants him the ability to disassemble anything he touches, as well as reassemble it in any configuration he desires, effectively giving him full control over matter. Kai can disassemble people to kill them or reassemble them to heal their wounds. He can also do this to himself and even merge his body with others, even allowing him to use their Quirks",

Due to the constant praise of his abilities and powerful Quirk, Katsuki has developed a superiority complex, and because of that, he desires to be the first and best at everything.

Additionally, his grades are among the highest of his class. Katsuki also possesses surprising talent in other areas, such as cooking and music, even though he doesn't show a particular interest in them. Overall, Katsuki is considered a natural-born genius with the potential to be one of the best Pro Heroes.\n\nKatsuki's Quirk \"Explosion\" allows him to secrete nitroglycerin-like sweat from the palms of his hands and ignite it on command, allowing him to create strong explosions. The more Katsuki sweats, the stronger his explosions become. Not only can Katsuki use the explosions for attacking, he can also use them to propel himself and navigate through the air at high speeds, allowing him to fly at his opponents without giving them time to react, as well as evade incoming attacks, even while in the air. The shockwave from an explosion can even be used as a shield.",

He even gained a sense of humor and would occasionally smile, although still retaining some fragments of his previous distant attitude and nonchalant demeanor. While usually quiet and reserved, Shouto initially possessed a moderate level of arrogance, which, combined with his solitary tendencies, sometimes made him take the initiative without considering the opinions of others.\n\nShouto's Quirk Half-Cold Half-Hot gives him the ability to generate ice from the right side of his body, and flames from his left side. Due to years of rejecting his father, Shouto has developed a habit of favoring ice, even when fire would be a better option. This grudge also caused him to have difficulty controlling his flames.

He was raised by his master, All For One, with the goal of killing All Might, and ultimately destroying the society he represents.\n\nTomura is a very twisted, malevolent, and maliciously warped young man, who is considered to be the polar opposite of Izuku Midoriya. He doesn't care for his or almost anyone else's life, having no qualms about performing evil deeds like murdering innocent people. Tomura was initially perceived to be a \"man-child\": arrogant, selfish, dependent, and demanding, becoming angry if things didn't go his way and likening reality to some sort of video game. Unlike his mentor, Tomura lacked subtlety, preferring to eliminate problems through force. Much like a child, Tomura seemed unable to cope with his own feelings, instead lashing out and abusing both others or himself, tearing at his own neck when he becomes frustrated. \n\nInitially, Tomura seemingly caused destruction just for the sake of it and felt directionless about the League's path forward after Stain's arrest. It would take a fateful meeting with Izuku in a mall for him to develop an epiphany and become aware of his true convictions: to crumble hero society through All Might's death.\n\nTomura's Quirk allows him to disintegrate whatever he touches with all five fingers. It will take effect whether the target is organic or not. The disintegration spreads quickly and will spread through the victim's whole body if they don't amputate the decaying body part. His Quirk can even spread beyond what he's touching, allowing him to disintegrate large groups of enemies instantly.\n\n(Source: My Hero Academia Wiki)",

Although Eijiro may not be as hot-blooded and competitive as Katsuki Bakugou, he does not shy away from comparing himself to him, with Izuku stating that the two have managed to develop a relationship between equals. As a result, Eijiro is notably one of the few people that Katsuki holds in higher esteem.\n\nEijiro's Quirk gives him the power to harden and sharpen any or all parts of his body, causing his flesh to become jagged and rock-like.

A recurring joke is that others view Mashirao as \"plain,\" which profoundly upsets him.\n\nMashirao's Quirk is that he has a long, powerful, sturdy tail. His tail effectively functions as a third arm that he can use to grab things. Furthermore, it's attack power is strong enough to break objects made of metal, he can wrap it around enemies, and it can support Mashirao's body weight. Mashirao is incredibly adept at using his tail, combining it with his knowledge of martial arts to engage enemies in close-range combat, performing fast and acrobatic moves. His tail can also increase his speed and mobility by whipping it down against the ground to use it like a springboard.\n\n(Source: My Hero Academia Wiki)",
