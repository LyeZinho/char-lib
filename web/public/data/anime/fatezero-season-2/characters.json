During his lifetime, Kiritsugu was disillusioned with becoming a Hero of Justice, a defender of humanity who could save everyone. Although he feels he failed to do so, his efforts were a source of inspiration for Shirou.  Prior to his fateful meeting with Shirou, Kiritsugu was notorious as the \"Magus Killer,\" a freelancer who would hunt down heretical magi. Although he was a magus with Magic Circuits and abilities he was considered unorthodox in that he would utilize modern technology and weaponry along with his magecraft to track down and kill magi.  Although mentioned and seen in flashbacks in Fate/stay night, Kiritsugu is one of the main protagonists in its prequel Fate/Zero.   \n\n~!It is hinted at in certain parts of Fate/stay night and confirmed in its prequel Fate/Zero that Kiritsugu is in fact Illyasviel von Einzbern's biological father, making Shirou and her step-siblings.!~",

Berserker is known to have three distinct Noble Phantasms, as shown on his status page. However, due to the enchantment that obscured his identity, his status page was shown blurred, making it impossible to identify the specific names and natures of his Phantasms, save for the sword Arondight. In addition, this Berserker is uniquely able to make anything he chooses into his own Noble Phantasm and effectively wield them, from telephone poles to the Noble Phantasms of other Servants.\nBerserker's real identity is Lancelot of the Lake. Until his identity was revealed, he had been known simply as the Black Knight.  Lancelot, known as the Knight of the Lake, had been loyal to Artoria, knowing both the king and the secrets of her sword well. Lancelot's downfall began when he loved Artoria's queen. Though the king was actually a woman, Artoria had married in order to present the image of a stable royal family before the kingdom and to maintain the illusion that she was a man in the face of the general public. Her queen willingly sacrificed her own life as a woman in order to fulfill the ideal of the stable government. However, Lancelot and the queen fell in love. Though he wanted to take her away, Lancelot's loyalty to Artoria and his sense of duty to serve the kingdom prevented him from doing so. When political enemies of the king exposed Lancelot and the queen's affair, the queen was ordered to be executed. Left with little choice, Lancelot rebelled in order to try and save her. The knight, the queen, who had made her beloved betray his duty, and the king, who felt responsible for the despair her most loyal servant endured, all suffered. Though Lancelot suffered greatly, he found that he could not hate Artoria, who had never blamed Lancelot for anything regarding the state of affairs they had become entangled in. In his despair, Lancelot desired to become a beast who had no worries; thus, when he became a Heroic Spirit, he became a Berserker-class spirit. !~ (Source: Wikipedia)",

      "description": "__Height:__ 161cm   \n\nA young woman who acts as Kiritsugu Emiya's assistant during the fourth Holy Grail War. She is cold and professional, which makes it easier for Kiritsugu to act as he needs to.  Little is known about her history, save that Kiritsugu had rescued her from a war-torn land many years ago. When Maiya was a child, she was forced into the army and trained to be a soldier. She later reveals to Irisviel von Einzbern, Kiritsugu's wife, that she had been raped by other soldiers and later lost her child. After rescuing her, Kiritsugu became Maiya's mentor and taught her his way of life.   \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Iskandar, or how he refers to himself, the King of Conquerors is a noble and courageous man, who prefers to conquer his enemies by winning without killing and controlling without humiliating. He is known as a marvelous ruler who once almost conquered the whole known world. He is not pragmatic, but is a person who lets history run its course and acts according to his impulses. While he is wild and somewhat inconsiderate to others, his greed ultimately resulted in the happiness of the people he ruled over.  In the new era, Rider is mostly amazed by ordinary modern things, and usually spends his free time exploring modern war vehicles and machinery.!~",
