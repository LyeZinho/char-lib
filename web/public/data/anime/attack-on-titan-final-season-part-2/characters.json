He grew up in the town with his parents and foster sister [Mikasa](https://anilist.co/character/40881), who moved in with the Yeagers as a child. Eren spent most of his time with Mikasa and their mutual best friend [Armin Arlert](https://anilist.co/character/46494), whom the pair often defended from neighborhood bullies.  \n\nEren is a passionate, determined, hardheaded, and impulsive young man. When they were children, Armin showed him a book depicting the wonders of the outside world. Eren grew to share Armin's curiosity of the world beyond the Walls and resolved to see it for himself. This dream inspired his admiration of the Survey Corps and his desire to join their ranks as soon as he became eligible for enrollment. \n\nWhen the Titans suddenly broke through Wall Maria into Shiganshina, Eren was forced to watch on as his mother became trapped under the rubble of their house and eaten by a titan. Forever changed from this event, Eren vows to kill every last titan.",

Eren discovered this and helped her escape her captors. Later, Eren gave her his scarf, which she constantly wears and shares an emotional attachment to. She was adopted by the Yaeger family soon after. Because of these past events, Mikasa shares an unbreakable bond with Eren and lives to protect him, constantly worrying for Eren's well-being. After the Titans broke through Wall Maria and killed her and Eren's mother, she chose to follow Eren into the military to try and keep him safe from danger. \n\nEven as a child, Mikasa possessed impressive fighting skill and strength, and that skill was only honed further during her training.  Mikasa is considered a genius among all the army trainees and is incredibly skilled at combat and agility, to the point that she was known as the greatest soldier among the 104th Training Corps and graduated in first place. Though being among the best of the best, she remains humble and refrains from displaying arrogance. Ultimately, Mikasa's loyalty remains with Eren no matter the circumstance, with her only true desire being to live a peaceful life with him.",

After Wall Maria was breached, he chose to join Mikasa and Eren in joining the military, both to try to make a good and meaningful impact on the world, and to fulfill his dream of seeing the outside world.\n\nEven when he was young, the naturally curious Armin has always had a deep fascination with the world beyond the Walls. As a child, he found and studied an illegal book about the outside world that was owned by his grandfather. He often shared the book and information contained in it with Eren Yeager, his best friend, and his dreams of seeing the world outside the walls. Armin was branded a heretic by other children for his unusual interest in the outside world and was thus frequently picked on. Too timid to defend himself, Armin would often rely on his friends Eren and Mikasa Ackerman to protect him from local bullies. This, coupled with his frail physique, was a deep shame for Armin, leading him to have poor self-esteem and to believe that he is a burden to others. Because of this, Armin has always been very eager to prove his worth, especially towards his close friends. \n\nArmin is known to be exceptionally loyal and selfless. He constantly worries for the safety of his friends, and he is always prepared to throw himself into dangerous situations to save them. Alongside his kindhearted nature and emotionally intelligence, Armin is a very analytical person. He likes to think deeply about situations and solve problems using his mind. These personality traits, in conjunction with his intelligence, good judgment, level headedness, ability to plan ahead, come up with creative ideas and to think outside the box, are what make him a great tactician. Although he may appear among the physically weakest of the 104th Training Corps, his incredible intelligence and strategic genius makes him an invaluable asset to any team.",

After she died, her spirit was split into the Nine Titans. She is observed to be a quiet character that does not reveal her true intentions/motives.\n\n~!\nShe submitted to the Eldian king in life, building him his empire, brutally destroying his enemies, and bearing his children as he commanded. Ymir even went so far as to sacrifice her own life for his. Even in death, her soul remained blindly obedient to the Eldian royal family, creating Titans by hand for about 2,000 years in the unknown land surrounding the Coordinate. She has only shown signs of embracing her own free will after she encountered Eren Yeager. However, it is possible she always had some free will, as she had intentionally freed a group of pigs from their pen and let them run free as a slave.\n\nAccording to Eren, Ymir waited thousands of years for someone to come to her and free her from the love she felt for King Fritz. That person was Mikasa.\n!~\n\n(Source: Attack on Titan Wiki)",

Wanting praise and recognition, Dazz undertook harsh physical training in the snowy mountains. However, he wasn't strong enough to endure it, and nearly died. Ymir told Krista to leave him behind or her own life would be endangered; when Krista refused, Ymir used her Titan shifter powers to bring Dazz back to the camp safely.  In Ch. 12, when Dot Pixis announces the plan to reconquer Trost District, Dazz has a breakdown and starts screaming that he doesn't want to die. Though Marco Bott tries to quiet him, a commanding officer overhears and threatens to execute him. Dazz replies that execution would be better then being eaten by a Titan. However, Dot Pixis then announces that all deserters will be pardoned -- but have to live with the guilt that they abandoned their families to the Titans. Dazz is unable to leave his family to that fate, and returns to participate in the operation to plug the breach.   After the mission, he briefly appears in Chapter 21 standing next to Sasha Blouse when Irvin Smith gives a speech urging the 104th Training Squad members to join the Scouting Legion. As he is not present in the group of trainees who join, he presumably opted for the Stationary Guard instead.!~ \n\n(Source: Shingeki no Kyojin Wikia)",
