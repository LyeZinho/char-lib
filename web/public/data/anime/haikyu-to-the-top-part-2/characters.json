Since he was young, Hinata trained his legs to compensate for his lack of height. He joins the Karusuno High School Volleyball team and amazes the team with his natural affinity as a spiker. Although he is a complete beginner and never had any experience playing in a volleyball team, he grows rapidly through each match.\n\n~!After graduating from high school, Hinata traveled to Brazil to gain experience by playing beach volleyball. This is when he got the name, Ninja Shoyo. Upon returning to Japan, he became a member of the MSBY Black Jackals, a Division 1 team in the V-League. He became a member of the Japan Men’s National Volleyball Team during the 2021 Olympics. Currently, that is the year 2022, he is a member of Asas São Paulo, a professional team in the Brazil Super League.!~",

Even though he isn't Karasuno's official setter anymore, he doesn't dream of giving up on playing in general. As such, he encourages himself and all of his teammates not to give up, no matter how rough the situation might be.\n\nSugawara's dedication to volleyball is clear when he decides to continue club activities even when most third years choose to retire to focus on their futures. In a meeting, his teacher asked Sugawara why he's so determined to continue playing even though he's not a starting member, and Sugawara replied that he doesn't want to have regrets in the future.\n\nHe is also quite perceptive as he noticed how Tanaka asked for the key to the gym (back during the first years' 3-on-3 match) even though he always comes in late, so Sugawara knew that something was up. He is also intelligent as he can come up with helpful tactics during the game. An example of this is when he came up with the idea of saying \"bring it\" and \"send it to me\" for Kageyama and Hinata's combo.",

His boisterous nature and crazy shenanigans can attract unwanted attention quite easily, which often bodes ill for him. Although he hardly ever worries about the consequences of his actions (and may even revert to violence in order to vent out his anger on certain occasions), he is surprisingly considerate of his friends' feelings and insecurities.\n\nYuu can be extremely impatient, excitable and impulsive. As Ryuunosuke Tanaka puts it, \"he simply gets too fired up for his own good.\" He doesn't bother to filter his words, and is therefore prone to blurting out whatever he's thinking in a loud and tactless manner. In-game, however, his attitude changes drastically: he becomes incredibly focused and serious, remaining calm and doing everything in his power to provide the support his team needs until the very end. For this reason, everyone in the volleyball club respects him greatly.",
