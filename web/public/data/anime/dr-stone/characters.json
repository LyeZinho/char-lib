She appears to be well known in her village due to her combative abilities, as both Kinro and Ginro were afraid of her. Kohaku excels at fighting, hunting, and general survival skills. She is a tomboy by nature, having little interest in more typical feminine activities and has little knowledge about them, although she does seem to enjoy some lavish clothing that was provided to her. She possesses a sharp instinct and intellect.\n\nKohaku is a kind young woman, caring deeply for her sickly older sister, willing to participate in the tournament for her hand in marriage just to protect her. This care extends to her comrades, and anyone she's loyal to. In addition to this, she has a reckless and hotheaded personality, often reacting in anger to being called a gorilla or lioness due to her strength and physicality. She also acts on her emotions at times, going against rational thought. She also has a bit of a teasing side, asking Chrome if he could fall for her to her resemblance to her sister.",

His outward appearance is masked by his mastery in psychology, but his actions tell of loyalty, determination, kindness and even sacrifice at times.\n\nWhile not nearly as intelligent in terms of science compared to Senku, he proves to be his equal and one of his most vital allies due to his ability to understand the human psyche and manipulate people through lies in contrast to Senku's more honest nature. He uses his abilities to promote cooperation and enthusiasm, motivate allies, conduct negotiations, and outsmart enemies. He tends to shift between acting as a ditzy airhead when it suits him (such as to avoid work or going into battle) and an intelligent manipulator. He is confident and is shown to have nerves of steel, even in the face of death.\n\nHe has frequently stated that his favourite drink is cola, and that he cannot handle alcohol.",
