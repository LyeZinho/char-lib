She appears to be well known in her village due to her combative abilities, as both Kinro and Ginro were afraid of her. Kohaku excels at fighting, hunting, and general survival skills. She is a tomboy by nature, having little interest in more typical feminine activities and has little knowledge about them, although she does seem to enjoy some lavish clothing that was provided to her. She possesses a sharp instinct and intellect.\n\nKohaku is a kind young woman, caring deeply for her sickly older sister, willing to participate in the tournament for her hand in marriage just to protect her. This care extends to her comrades, and anyone she's loyal to. In addition to this, she has a reckless and hotheaded personality, often reacting in anger to being called a gorilla or lioness due to her strength and physicality. She also acts on her emotions at times, going against rational thought. She also has a bit of a teasing side, asking Chrome if he could fall for her to her resemblance to her sister.",

His outward appearance is masked by his mastery in psychology, but his actions tell of loyalty, determination, kindness and even sacrifice at times.\n\nWhile not nearly as intelligent in terms of science compared to Senku, he proves to be his equal and one of his most vital allies due to his ability to understand the human psyche and manipulate people through lies in contrast to Senku's more honest nature. He uses his abilities to promote cooperation and enthusiasm, motivate allies, conduct negotiations, and outsmart enemies. He tends to shift between acting as a ditzy airhead when it suits him (such as to avoid work or going into battle) and an intelligent manipulator. He is confident and is shown to have nerves of steel, even in the face of death.\n\nHe has frequently stated that his favourite drink is cola, and that he cannot handle alcohol.",

      "description": "Position: Center / Defensive Tackle / Long snapper  Jersey: 77  40 yard dash: 6.5 seconds  Bench Press: 160 kg (352 lb)  Height: 195 cm (6' 4\")  Weight: 145 kg (319 lb)  Graduated From: Mao 13th Middle School  2nd Year Student (Grade 11)    The largest and strongest player in the Deimon American Football club. Kurita lives in a temple with his father, who is the director of a Buddhist sect. His father believed that to grow up big and strong, a young boy had to eat a lot, but unfortunately it seems he has overfed his son. Kurita, as his name would suggest, has a head shaped like a chestnut. He is a very sweet, kind-hearted individual and the only thing bigger than his body is his heart. He became Sena's second friend after entering Deimon High School. When playing, Kurita shouts his kiai \"Funnuraba!\" when exerting extra effort. Before coming to Deimon, he attended the Shinryuji school, but was forced out because Kongo Agon was chosen over him for the special athletic scholarship, so he came to Deimon High along with Hiruma and Musashi. Like Hiruma. Kurita is crazy about American football and tries to encourage everyone to join though he does not go to the same extremes as his demonic compatriot. He can get so worked up that he's been known to begin morning practice as early as 2:00 AM.   His \"apprentice\" is Komusubi, who practices with him whenever he can. His biggest dream is to compete in the Christmas Bowl. He is somewhat dim-witted (nearly giving away Sena's other identity) and is insanely strong (he accidentally destroyed a small truck by hugging it). Also, whenever fights ensue, between the Deimon members, he always stops them by flattening all of them. Though he normally looks rather comical, he's dangerous when he's actually fired up. When Musashi rejoins the team, Kurita's \"alternate personality\" is revealed during the games. Kurita's face changes as his eyes inflame and become bigger, his eyebrows thicken, and his face tightens up. He gains even more strength than usual in this \"form\" (although he can quickly change back when he gets happy, but change back again as the game resumes).   (Source: Wikipedia)",
