      "description": "**Height**: 179 cm (5'10\")\n\nL Lawliet is a world-renowned detective who takes on the challenge of catching Kira. In his investigation, L becomes suspicious of [Light Yagami](https://anilist.co/character/80/Light-Yagami) and makes it his goal to prove that Light is Kira. L is very secretive and only communicates with the world through his assistant, [Watari](https://anilist.co/character/2179/Quillsh-Wammy). He never shows his face to the world in person, instead, representing himself with a capital letter L.\n\nL is highly intelligent, though his disheveled and languid appearance masks his great powers of deduction, and many question his abilities upon viewing him. L tends to second-guess everything he is presented with and is extremely meticulous and analytical. He is good at deceiving his opponents and is willing to take drastic measures to solve a case. He is also shown to have a dry sense of humor, and he isn't above making sarcastic remarks to people. Although he tends to be polite to some, L can seem condescending at times.\n\nL has several quirks, such as preferring to crouch rather than sit, eating only sweet foods, and holding items by using only a thumb and a finger. He is often seen arranging objects and very intently stacking, or in other ways playing with, his staple food items. L is almost always encountered while performing actions that are considered inappropriate or rude in public. These actions/habits include biting fingernails, placing feet on furniture, slouching, chewing with an open mouth, talking with his mouth full, and calling out personal observations that may offend others.",

He acts for his own interests and entertainment, and often fails to tell Light key details about the Death Note. Ryuk is selfish, however, and will aid Light if it serves his own goals, such as providing amusement or obtaining apples, which he loves.",

Ohba said that he created Aiber and Wedy so he could use characters with &quot;special abilities&quot; to advance the storyline. He said that he wanted to use Wedy more than Aiber. As an example he explained a scenario involving Light controlling Wedy, making her place cameras in the headquarters so Misa could see L&#039;s face &quot;... or something.&quot;    According to Obata, he drew Wedy as a female model as he did not know what kind of character she would be. Obata added that Wedy has the &quot;stereotypical female spy look.&quot; Obata believes that if he drew Aiber and Wedy to look &quot;a little bit more original&quot;, Ohba could have included the characters in a larger role in Death Note.     ~!After L&#039;s death, Light kills her using his Death Note; Mary Kenwood dies in a motorcycle accident in Colorado.!~",

In fact, Ryuk takes his Note and gives it to Light, which becomes Higuchi's note and is finally passed on to Mello's gang (more specifically, Mello's subordinate, Kal Snyder (also known as Jack Neylon)). Shidoh has a great liking for chocolate. Since Shidoh has neglected to kill people and extend his own lifetime, he probably did not notice that his Note is stolen. As the end of his lifetime approaches, Shidoh finds Ryuk and learns that Mello is in possession of his Note. Later, he finds Snyder in the human world. To regain his Note, Shidoh agrees to help Mello's gang against the SPK and Light. After Light regains the Death Note from Mello, he returns the note to Shidoh for him to stop interfering and return to the Shinigami world. Although these events occurred over the course of about one volume in the manga, Shidoh was only in two episodes in the anime version (episode 28 where he was merely introduced in the last few minutes of the episode, and episode 29, which relays most events of Shidoh's regaining of his Death Note).    Shidoh's name is written in English as &quot;Shidoh&quot; in Death Note: How to Read 13, but written &quot;Sidoh&quot; in both the tankōbon character introductions page and within the translated English manga.    *Wiki",
