  "description": "Kinoshita Kazuya is a 20-year-old failure of a college student. He managed to kiss his girlfriend once, but was dumped after a month. \"Ugh... Damn it. I never want to go through that again.\" \n\nCompletely spiteful, Kazuya uses a certain method to date a girl. He goes to their meeting place and suddenly hears, \"You're Kazuya-kun, right?\" A beautiful girl brushing her long, black hair behind her ear was there, smiling at him. Her name was Mizuhara Chizuru. Something real is born after just a single rental! A reckless rom-com filled with love and excitement is about to begin!\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
