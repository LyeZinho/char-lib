      "description": "__Height:__ 160 cm  \n\n Futaba often shied away from boys, writing them off as crude, rough and vulgar all except the mild voiced- small built Kou. They shared a brief attraction to each other.   One day Kou suddenly moved away without any notice leaving behind a stunned Futaba.   Futaba's life took a drastic turn after Kou's departure - the other boys started to take notice of Futaba's flawless face, alienating her from the rest of the girls. They began to hate Futaba and blame her eventually exiling her altogether​. Now in high school, Futaba is determined to not be too girly in order to avoid a repetition of what happened in her middle school years. \n\n(Source: Ao Haru Ride wiki)",

His parents divorced and he now lives with his father (presumably he first lived with his mother after the divorce, but when starting high school he moved in with his father instead, for unknown reasons). Currently attending the same highschool as Futaba under a new last name (probably his mother's). He eventually admits to being \"Tanaka-kun\", and while acting cold and uncaring towards her most of the time, his nice side becomes gradually more prominent.\n\n(Source: Ao Haru Ride wiki)",

She is very cute, causing her to be despised by many girls in her class, and she is often left alone. Yuuri gets by very well, however, for she prefers to be hated for who she truly is than to be liked for someone she isn't. Yuuri and Futaba soon become best friends. She falls in love with Kou after he helps her during a class leader's camp. Yuuri greatly treasures her friendship with Futaba, but often gets jealous of Futaba's closeness with Kou.\n\n(Source: Ao Haru Ride wiki)",

Due to experiences in middle school, Shuuko fails to trust girls. She has been in love with Tanaka-sensei, Kou's older brother, since her first year of high school after attending a guidance session between the two of them. Eventually, her trust in female relationships was restored after becoming friends with Futaba and Yuuri.",
