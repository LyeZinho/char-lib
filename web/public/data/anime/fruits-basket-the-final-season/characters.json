She loves to cook and describes herself as an excellent housekeeper. She also has an after-school job as a janitor to pay her tuition fees to avoid being a burden on her grandfather.

Tohru's mother, [Kyoko](https://anilist.co/character/9754), raised her alone until she died in a car accident shortly after Tohru entered high school, a few months before the start of the story. Tohru repeatedly calls Kyoko the most important person in her life and treasures her photograph. \n\n~!When she falls in love with Kyo she feels guilty of being \"unfaithful\" to her mother's memory.!~\n\n~!In the first half of the series, as Tohru learns about the zodiac curse and its effects on those she loves, she becomes distressed, and when she learns that the dangerous Akito is the \"god\" of the zodiac, she resolves to break the curse. Only later does she admit that she wants to free Kyo most of all.!~  ~!In the last chapter, she begins moving with Kyo to another city so he can continue his martial arts training, and in the final pages they are shown as a loving elderly couple with a granddaughter.!~",

Kyo was always separated from the Soma clan, including his parents, which is likely the cause of his short-fused temperament and stubbornness.

Somehow, Tohru convinced him that he does have a reason to live, he just hasn't found it yet. Shigure likes to play with Ritsu's insecurities and gullibility, much as he does his editor, [Mitsuru](https://anilist.co/character/9759).\n\n~!When the two meet, they realize they have this in common. In the final chapter of the manga, Ritsu tells Kagura, while giving her one of his women's kimonos, that he has asked Mitsuru on a date, and in a bonus story in the first fan-book, he and Mitsuru are a couple.!~  \n\nNatsuki Takaya derived his name from the eighth month, odakaritsuki or \"rice harvest month,\" which is the month of the monkey, of the traditional Japanese calendar. In an author's note, Takaya said that she regretted how little role Ritsu played in the main story.\n\n(Source: AbsoluteAnime.com)",

      "description": "Arisa is a former gang member (a *yankee*: a Japanese version of the American \"gangster thug\" image) and has been one of Tohru's closest friends since Tohru's mother helped her escape from the gang (called \"The Ladies\") when she wanted to leave it.\n\nArisa is tough, brash, and sometimes violent but cries easily when it comes to her friends. She wears long skirts, carries a lead pipe, and often speaks like a man (in Japanese, different word choices can categorize a speaker as male or female). Arisa likes to play cards, protect Tohru from Yuki's fangirls, and swim. Her \"convoluted\" personality stems from home problems early in her life, when her mother left Arisa and her father for another man; her father became an alcoholic after his rejection. This caused Arisa to become harsh and jaded in her views of the world until she met the kind Tohru and her mother, Kyoko. With her overprotective and rather \"parental\" protection of Tohru with Hana-chan, she comes off as the brash and direct \"father\" figure.\n~!She falls in love with [Kureno Sohma](https://anilist.co/character/4644/Kureno-Soma).!~",

      "description": "Saki is a psychic girl with a goth-like appearance who has the ability to sense people&#039;s &quot;auras&quot; and send out electric waves (denpa in Japanese). Much like Arisa, Saki is extremely protective of Tohru, who was the first person in school who had truly accepted her. She is very observant, polite, and loves to eat (and is rarely seen not eating outside of school). Her nickname (Hana-chan) and her manga symbol, a violet with fangs, relate humorously in that hana means &quot;flower&quot; in Japanese. Hanajima has a close relationship to her family who accept and even nurture her gifts (her younger brother, Megumi, looks up to Hanajima, has his own special ability so that she wouldn&#039;t be the only &quot;weird&quot; one in the family). Her mother seems to resemble Tohru&#039;s protective and caring nature (maybe explaining her attachment to Tohru). In the near &quot;parental&quot; protection she and Arisa give Tohru, she acts as the protective &quot;motherly&quot; figure. ~! When Kazuma comes in for Kyo&#039;s parent/teacher conference, Hana notes that he is &quot;handsome&quot;. Kyo is not too keen on the idea of Saki as his &quot;mother&quot;.!~",
