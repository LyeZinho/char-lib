Because of his fearsome appearance and odd habits he is widely mistaken to be a scary, bloodthirsty carnivore. Legoshi is wholly aware of this and does everything in his power to minimize himself and downplay his intimidating aspects. The series is largely about him coming to terms with his place in the world as a wolf.\n\nLegoshi develops some complicated feelings for the rabbit Haru.\n\n~!He is a 1/4 komodo dragon, because of his grandfather Gosha.!~",
