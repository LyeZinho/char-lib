      "description": "The youngest executive of Manhattan's Martillo Family Camorra. Firo is surprisingly friendly, humorous and compassionate, but he is a skilled fighter and can be ruthless or even vengeful towards those who bring harm to the people he cares about. He became a complete immortal in November 1930 after accidentally drinking Szilard Quates' immortality elixir. In the same year he falls in love with Ennis, and despite the fact that she initially is unsure of her affection due to her underdeveloped emotional capabilities, they live together as roommates and gradually she reciprocates Firo's feelings.\n\n~!Firo has unconscious issues with femininity due to a childhood incident wherein he was mistaken for a girl and nearly molested. His complex about being called girly suggests a lingering stigma, but this does not mean he dislikes women—on the contrary, he treats them with chivalry, never harming them and considering any man who does so as scum. He is also shy when it comes to romance and refrains from taking the initiative even when his feelings are obvious, as shown with his relationship with Ennis. All of these traits can be traced back to the incident from his childhood, making it one of the most formative events of his life.!~\n\n~!Firo marries Ennis in the early 1980s and the two honeymoon aboard the yacht ship Entrance in 2002.!~",

Chane is thoroughly devoted and at a young age, she requested that Huey remove her voice so that she would be unable to reveal his secrets to anyone.   ~!In 1931, Chane boarded the Flying Pussyfoot as part of the terrorist group that wished to use its passengers as hostages, in order to negotiate Huey's release from prison.

She also knew that at some point, the group planned to betray and kill her. Yet, she went along with their plans in order to see how much they would be able to accomplish.   While aboard the Flying Pussyfoot, Chane has a run-in with the sadistic assassin Ladd Russo, from the Russo Mafia Family. They engage in a fierce battle, where Chane's fighting skills impress and delight Ladd. The fight is eventually interrupted by the \"Rail Tracer,\" who takes a liking to Chane and proposes to her.

After the events aboard the Flying Pussyfoot, Chane is taken in and cared for by Jacuzzi Splot and his gang. Their kindness confuses Chane, who does not understand why they went out of their way to help her as she is a stranger and member of the terrorist group.   While in their company, she is kidnapped by Graham Spector who mistakes her for Eve Genoard. At Graham's warehouse, she surprises the young man and his gang by attacking him with her daggers, thus revealing to them that she is not Eve. Her battle skills impress Graham, who begins to get excited at the prospect of fighting her. However, Jacuzzi interrupts the fight as he intends to rescue Chane. It does not take long before Nice Holystone and the rest of Jacuzzi's gang also show up to help both Jacuzzi and Chane. Chane is dumbfounded by their actions, and is shocked even more when the Rail Tracer also shows up to her aid.  Once again, the Rail Tracer, who is in fact Claire Stanfield (aka. Vino), an assassin for the Gandor family, confesses his love and says that she does not have to fall in love with him right away, but asks her if they could start out as friends and she could try to.
