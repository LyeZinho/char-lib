This ability allows him to extract weapons from his friends known as a \"Void\" which is a manifestation of a person's personality.  He is an unsociable 17-year-old young man who usually tends to stay out of people's way so as to not cause them any trouble. However, this changes when he meets a girl named Inori Yuzuriha. From that moment on, he must learn how to make friends because of his ability \"The Power of King\".   \n\n__Episode 15 spoilers__\n~!After Hare dies, Shu goes to Inori and forces her Void out against her will to slaughter all four Endlaves with emotionless eyes. Afterwards, he says that kindness is pointless and that he is going to become \"The King\".   After the sudden resurrection of Gai, Shu's arm was cut off by Inori's Void, which was forced out by the-now 'evil' Gai.  After acquiring the second Void Genome Shu reacquires the King's Power and uses his own void as a replacement arm for the one that was cut off; It is shown that his Void absorbs all traits and also acts as a inventory allowing him to store voids; the trade back however is that he also acquires the negatives affects such as Souta's cancer when he used Souta's void.!~   \n\n__Episode 22 spoilers__\n~!After Shu kills Gai, the Void Genome he previously owned fuses with his Void. He decides to use his Void to absorb all of the Apocalypse Cancer, whilst sacrificing himself and going down together with Inori, who was about to die in his arms. When meeting Inori in that Void-dimension, she asks Shu to take the Cat's Cradle. He accepts it, unknowingly that Inori was about to sacrifice herself to save Shu. He then suddenly breaks out of the Apocalypse Crystals.  A few years later he's seen celebrating Hare's birthday. He has lost his sight, probably when he was absorbing everyone's cancer including that of Inori, losing his sight in progress.  Afterwards, he's seen reminiscing about Inori and the short time they've spent together.!~",

She is also the voice of the internet artist Egoist who sings to release her emotions.  Inori is a very soft, quiet, and sweet girl, who is also very determined to complete her missions successfully and without fail (shown when she was threatened but didn’t show any sign of fear, even when she was about to be killed). She also seems to think she’s a burden to others but tries to protect the people close to her.   She usually comforts Shu and gives him words of strength when she can tell he’s feeling weak and helpless. Gai is dear to Inori, and she tells Shu that he is the one that gave her a name and a world, when no one else has.  As a member of Funeral Parlor, Inori is extremely skilled in forms of combat such as hand-to-hand fighting and marksmanship, to the point where she is able to outmatch and kill several soldiers of the GHQ forces by herself.",

She is also Undertaker's sole Endlave combat pilot. She can't stand feeling dependent on others, so she firmly rejects any and all help from others. There are two things Ayase dislikes more than anything - being offered help by others because of her disability and if someone is watching her while she is trying to crawl back into her wheelchair on her own. She believes the process itself doesn't make her look very elegant.    Even though Ayase is disabled, she is valued and respected by all Undertaker members for her Endlave piloting skills. This paralyzed girl makes her Endlave which weights many tons of armor grade steel-alloy move on the battlefield with uncanny precision.  Ayase being the only pilot of Endlave mobile combat platform is instrumental to all Undertaker operations. Her primary job is to draw the attention of the enemy Endlaves away from the Undertaker's main objectives and provide support and cover for other Units.  Most of the time during combat Ayase finds herself outnumbered at least three to one, but still, are able to hold her own against enemy Endlaves. Originally, she piloted an older Endlave Jumeau model before it was destroyed by Daryl, but later gains Daryl's Endlave Steiner model.  Ayase has feelings for Gai and is very loyal to him. She was eager to accept all responsibility for losing her original Endlave in combat, after successfully holding off multiple, newer and more advanced enemy Endlave models with her older model for 18 minutes. After listening to her report, Gai simply tells her that the fault is his own and that he is not fit to be the Undertaker's Commander for giving her such cruel order, to which she blushed furiously.   \n\n ~!Ayase's Void is a compensation for the disabled girl's one and only shortcoming. It's a direct reflection of Ayase's hearts' deepest wish and decides - to be able to proudly stand on her own two legs. Something that most people take for granted. This powerful Void manifested itself as a reinforced lower-body exoskeleton providing its user with amazing agility, mobility, and jumping power. Strangely enough, it also possesses a roller-skates type capability allowing for a swift movement over flat surfaces. It is possible that because Ayase is so used to Endlaves which utilize skating instead of walking to quickly move in and out of combat - it caused the same ability manifest in her Void as well.!~  At first Ayase is apprehensive toward Shu, because of his lack of firm character and indecisiveness, but later on she warms up to him as she starts to see him change as a person and yet remain the same as a human being.   ~! As Shu ready to leave for the decisive battle and wishes to return everyone's voids in case he doesn't come back, Ayase is the first one who tells him that she wishes him to keep her void for if Shu loses - all their lives are forfeit.!~",
