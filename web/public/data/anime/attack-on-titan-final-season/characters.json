Mikasa is considered a genius among all the army trainees and is incredibly skilled at combat and agility, to the point that she was known as the greatest soldier among the 104th Training Corps and graduated in first place.

After Wall Maria was breached, he chose to join Mikasa and Eren in joining the military, both to try to make a good and meaningful impact on the world, and to fulfill his dream of seeing the outside world.\n\nEven when he was young, the naturally curious Armin has always had a deep fascination with the world beyond the Walls. As a child, he found and studied an illegal book about the outside world that was owned by his grandfather. He often shared the book and information contained in it with Eren Yeager, his best friend, and his dreams of seeing the world outside the walls. Armin was branded a heretic by other children for his unusual interest in the outside world and was thus frequently picked on. Too timid to defend himself, Armin would often rely on his friends Eren and Mikasa Ackerman to protect him from local bullies. This, coupled with his frail physique, was a deep shame for Armin, leading him to have poor self-esteem and to believe that he is a burden to others. Because of this, Armin has always been very eager to prove his worth, especially towards his close friends. \n\nArmin is known to be exceptionally loyal and selfless. He constantly worries for the safety of his friends, and he is always prepared to throw himself into dangerous situations to save them. Alongside his kindhearted nature and emotionally intelligence, Armin is a very analytical person. He likes to think deeply about situations and solve problems using his mind. These personality traits, in conjunction with his intelligence, good judgment, level headedness, ability to plan ahead, come up with creative ideas and to think outside the box, are what make him a great tactician. Although he may appear among the physically weakest of the 104th Training Corps, his incredible intelligence and strategic genius makes him an invaluable asset to any team.",

Jean was also very cynical about defeating the Titans, believing that humanity has no chance against them and openly mocking more idealistic individuals like [Eren Yeager](https://anilist.co/character/40882/Eren-Yeager), and saw resisting the Titans as a hopeless cause. However, despite these things, and although he presents himself as self-centered, Jean places high value on the lives of his comrades, and is willing to risk his life to prevent countless more deaths from his comrades. Even with his shortcomings, Jean has shown himself to be a natural leader, being able to understand others and assess situations well because of his flaws, and proves capable of leading his fellow soldiers when they are left confused and without a plan.",

When fighting, he becomes animated and lively, often making a scene or otherwise throwing insults and witticisms. However, he also fought with control and was able to effortlessly sneak up on his targets when they least expected him. His preferred method of killing during his time as a serial killer was to slit the throats of his victims which earned him his infamous handle \"Kenny the Ripper\", and it was rumored that he murdered over 100 members of the Military Police Brigade. However, decades later his killings ceased and the terror that he once inspired dwindled into an Urban Legend. He eventually was found working under the Royal Government, the reasoning for his sudden shift in behavior being a mystery. Kenny is ultimately, despite his comical personality, very cold and calculated, sparing little emotional attachment or loyalty to anyone, with only a few exceptions.\n\n~!ㅤ\nHe notably shares the same bloodline as both [Levi](https://anilist.co/character/45627/Levi) and [Mikasa Ackerman](https://anilist.co/character/40881/Mikasa-Ackerman).!~",

When the 145th Fritz King built the walls and decided to move to the island Paradis, her branch of the Fritz family stayed behind due to disagreements with the King's choice. She joined the Eldia Restorationists on Marley, in order to revive the pride and power of Eldia. In this group, she also met Grisha Yeager, whom she eventually married. She gave birth to their son, Zeke Yeager. At the age of 7, there son reported his parents to the Marley government. As a result, all the Eldia Restorationists were sent to Utopia. Sergeant Major Gross injected Dina with the Titan serum and she was thrown off the Borderline wall to Utopia, as Grisha, in horror, watched his wife turn into a Titan.!~\n\n~!After the Colossus Titan breaches Shiganshina District in Wall Maria, many Titans proceed inside and among them is Dina. She embarks inside the town and is seen by Eren and Mikasa as they try to free Carla Yeager, who is trapped under the debris of their house. Though Hannes initially comes to their aid and decides to face Dina, he stands catatonic in fear of her frightening appearance. After he realizes that he is too afraid to face it, he opts to instead take Eren and Mikasa to safety, leaving Eren's mother behind. Afterwards, Eren witnesses Dina pull Carla out of the debris, as it proceeds to violently incapacitate her and devour her shortly thereafter.!~\n\n~!Five years later, after Eren had already joined the Survey Corps, Dina appears again before Eren and Mikasa outside the Titan Forest during the military's pursuit of the Armored Titan. After killing Hannes, who was protecting Eren and Mikasa before he was devoured, the Titan reaches out for Eren, who punches its hand. This activates powers Eren was previously unaware of, and seemingly gains control over the surrounding Titans. The ones that are under his control proceed to kill Dina by ripping her to shreds and devouring her, avenging the deaths of Carla and Hannes.!~",

She is usually calm and collected, her demeanour remaining unchanged even when Jean Kirstein yelled at her for failing to see her job through.

Yelena appears to maintain a very relaxed demeanour while having dry, humorous undertones to much of her actions.\n\n~!It is later revealed that Yelena was born into an unassuming family in Marley, and eventually became disillusioned with her own country. After meeting Zeke Yeager, Yelena concocted a plan to solidify herself in history by helping Zeke save the world. As part of her narrative, Yelena created a false background for herself, claiming that her homeland was invaded and conquered by Marley. She was forcibly drafted as a soldier to fight in the Marleyan military, where she met similar-minded soldiers and organized them into the Anti-Marleyan Volunteers to fight against Marley.!~",

Much of this mindset stems from her experiences during the Battle of Trost District, where she claims to have learned from watching Mikasa Ackerman fight in the face of adversity to achieve victory. She believes that the ends justify the means, and has no qualms about breaking rules if she believes that disobeying others will get her what she wants.",

Initially tasked with working under the training corps, they eventually were incorporated into the front guard due to the number of titans. Catching the group unaware, a titan lunged at the rooftop they were standing on. The group scattered but unfortunately, Thomas wasn't fast enough.
