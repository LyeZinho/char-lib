Despite her relaxed exterior and her initial claim of wanting to get along with demons, she can be rather cruel and harbors a great deal of anger towards them. She is generally kind to other humans, but is rather sadistic in her treatment of demons. As a pillar, she is a top-class fighter despite her small stature. She is also well-versed in medical knowledge, and can concoct poisons and medicines alike. \n\n~!During the Infinity Castle Arc, she encounters the Upper 2 demon Douma and is slain by him in a fight. However, since she poisoned herself before the fight, Douma is severely incapacitated after eating her.!~",

He also shows a somewhat nicer side towards Tanjiro after their mission and starts to accept him more as the series goes on.\n\nTengen is a very tall, wide-set man of a bulky, muscular build with lightly-tanned skin. His hair is white and of uneven length, the longest strands reaching his shoulders, and is styled with three more notable, shorter clumps arching up to fall as bangs between his eyes and on either side of his face. Tengen is most often seen wearing a sleeveless and dark turquoise version of the standard Demon Slayer uniform. He also wears two thick, golden rings around his upper arms.",
