But when he associates with [Reki](https://anilist.co/character/195120/Reki-Kyan) he wears baggy clothes consisting of dark pants, a blue coat, and a gray-colored shirt.\n\nLanga was born in Canada to a Japanese mother and Canadian father and grew up snowboarding. As a teenager, he and his mother moved to Okinawa to start anew.\n\n(Source: Sk8 Wiki)",
