He is regarded as one of the Forty-One Supreme Beings by the NPCs of the Great Tomb of Nazarick. He is the creator of Sebas Tian. At some point in YGGDRASIL, Touch Me participated in an official martial tournament and defeated all of his adversaries. By winning the tournament, he was awarded a special prize that comes in two. Firstly, he was given a special job class known as the \"World Champion\" of Álfheimr, and in addition he was awarded with the pure white armor set called \"Compliance with Law.\"\n\nTouch Me's outfit consists of shining white armor and a helm. His chest piece contains a huge sapphire embedded in the middle, which radiates with pure and divine light.\nHe is also adorned with a reddish cape attached around his right shoulder. Additionally, he is armed with both sword and shield. Touch Me's actual facial appearance in real life is said to look exactly like Sebas Tian. \n\nAs Touch Me played YGGDRASIL, he decided to assist the heteromorphic players during a time when they were being hunted down for fun through PKing. Thus, that was how he met Momonga, by saving him from a PK party; the two started becoming friends since then. There was also a time when Bukubukuchagama could not find a party to adventure with due to her appearance, so he was the one who approached her before anyone else. Afterwards, they formed a party together with other non-human characters and organized the First Nine, also known as Nine's Own Goal.\n\nAfter that, the clan grew with members chosen and invited personally by Touch Me, becoming a stable and friendly group. However, he felt that the clan was beginning to slowly fall apart. During one of its meetings, Touch Me was seen looking troubled by Momonga and Peroroncino, but their concerns were brushed aside. Once all the clan members had arrived, Touch Me started the meeting by having Nishikienrai report his latest discovery of a new unexplored dungeon. After the various clan members discussed the pros and cons of the dungeon, it was agreed that the clan would launch a raid.  Touch Me then moved unto the next point in the agenda of the meeting, in which he formally announced his intention to dissolve the Clan. His declaration elicited many protests, however he informed them that he wished to form Nine's Own Goal as an official Guild. Hearing the majority of the Clan concur to the idea, Touch Me decided to turn down the suggestion to become the Guildmaster. Just as several members of the groups argued about who should become Guildmaster, Touch Me restored order and nominated Momonga as their new guild leader, a proposal which many accepted. \n\nTouch Me is looked upon as very righteous and fair. He would help people in times of trouble without hesitation, and scolds his friends if one of them did something wrong. Momonga describes Touch Me as someone who is a straightforward person, the kind who was very direct in his words and deeds. However, Touch Me can be self-reflective at times, as evidenced when he was willing to step down as clan leader and proposed for someone else to be the guild master rather than him. If what Ulbert said is true; about him chasing away one of their former clansman leaving the game, then this might be part of the reason why Touch Me decided to step down voluntarily as a candidate for Guildmaster. \n\n(Source: Overlord Wikia)",

      "description": "Brain is a warrior turned mercenary after he lost to Gazef Stronoff in a grand tournament to determine the strongest fighter in Re-Estize Kingdom. He has brown eyes with blue hair and the appearance of a wild beast. He is equipped with a chainmail and wears a necklace and ring which are infused with protection magic. His whole body is lean and his muscles are tough as steel and tempered through experience.\n\nOriginally a farmer, he was gifted with what could only be described as a God-given talent in the mastery of the sword. He has always believed himself to be the strongest fighter inside the Kingdom, having never lost a fight before he entered the grand tournament to decide the King's guard captain. He easily fought his way to the final where he faced off against Gazef Stronoff. A grand and close battle ensued between the two, but eventually,​ he would taste his first defeat at the hand of Gazef.\n\nHis fame was shattered and his confidence as an unbeatable warrior took a hit. He then decided to do everything he could to become stronger, so he would truly become unbeatable. At the same time, in order to make a living he started working as a mercenary for the Death Spreading Brigade. \n\n~!When first introduced he is very arrogant, thinking that he is the most powerful, even though he earlier lost to Gazef. While a mercenary, he suffered a devastating defeat at the hand of Shalltear Bloodfallen when she attacked the hideout of the Death Spreading Brigade. After that, his personality changes drastically. Having his confidence completely crushed and getting a feel of what true terror is like, his attitude changes to one where he is completely depressed, hinting at a suicidal tendency.\n\nHe eventually does a complete overhaul after meeting Climb and Sebas Tian. He changes to a much friendlier person that starts to think that strength is more than simply being skilled with a sword.\n\nIn his second encounter with Shalltear, he managed to chip off Shalltear's pinky fingernail using Fourfold Slash of Light.\n\nIn the web novel version, he becomes a vampire under Shalltear.!~\n\n(Source: Overlord Wikia)",
