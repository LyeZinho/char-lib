  "description": "The fourth season of Shokugeki no Souma.\n\nThe ultimate Regimental Food War continues as the culinary rebels led by Souma and the members of Kyokusei square off against epicurean elitist Azami and the Toutsuki Ten. At stake – the future of dining across Japan. Because if the rebels fail, Azami intends to impose his own tastes and techniques on the entire restaurant industry!\n\nBut the fine dining control freak has made a serious mistake in threatening the futures of Souma’s friends and family, as while the rebels may seem less experienced overall, this is ultimately a clash of skill, dedication, and, most of all, taste. That may be a recipe for disaster for the seasoned veterans!\n\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",
