Because she is intimidated very easily, she makes simple mistakes when she cooks, causing many of her classmates to see her as a weak student. She is quick to panic when something goes awry and tends to over think situations when under pressure or stress, such as repeatedly packing and unpacking a suitcase to make sure she packed something, even though she did not need to pack a suitcase in the first place.\nInitially, she heavily relied on Sōma's creativity to pull them both through tough assignments both in the academy and at the Training Camp.

He enrolled in Tōtsuki at the behest of his uncle, taking with him his mezzaluna (two-handed knife) and a bottle of homemade olive oil as a good luck charm. His specialty is Italian cuisine, although many professional chefs noted that he has a broad vision; like Sōma, he will incorporate ingredients and methods from other culinary styles to create inventive dishes, and can modify his recipes while cooking. He is very kind and supportive of his less-skilled brother, to the point of risking his pride to defend Isami's honor.\n\nTakumi has a fierce (and somewhat one-sided) rivalry with Sōma. Takumi sees Sōma as someone similar to himself – both having grown-up working at small family restaurants – and a worthy rival, and jumps at any chance to compete with him. He frequently tries to challenge Sōma to informal cooking challenges (usually leading to an embarrassing situation for himself), hoping to one day defeat Sōma in a formal Shokugeki.
