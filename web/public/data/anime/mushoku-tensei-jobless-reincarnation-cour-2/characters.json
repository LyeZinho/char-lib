      "description": "__Height:__ 175 cm (5'9\")\n\nRudeus is a tall, well-built, and cool-looking man. However, before his reincarnation, he was originally an overweight 34-year-old Japanese NEET who became a recluse following his high-school persecution. Because of his former life, he is careful not to get carried away and become arrogant. As a result, he is extremely self-aware and humble because he does not want to revert to his old self. He is a kind person, helping his friends and protecting his family whenever needed. Due to being capable in many fields, people have high expectations of him. His current body possesses a high affinity for magic even as a child. Rudeus is very polite to others, often making them uncomfortable.\n\nRudeus is one of the few people capable of using a voiceless incantation, and even rarer as a person who can use voiceless incantation with melded magics. He cannot use voiceless incantation for healing magic due to his lack of understanding in regards to how mana is manipulated to heal. A normal Magician takes at least five seconds for a simple spell, while for higher-level spells it's thirty to sixty seconds. Rudeus can do it almost instantly no matter what difficulty of the spell, with the exception of healing magic.",
