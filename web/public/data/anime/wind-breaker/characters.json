      "description": "__Height:__ 169 cm\n\nHaruka Sakura is a high school student in his first year. He attends Fuurin, a school known as a delinquent school, with aspirations to reach the top. He admires strong people. Rejected by others for his rough appearance, being alone was natural for him.  Hated by others and sitting at the bottom of the social strata, Sakura believes fighting is his only saving grace and that by winning those fights, he thinks he can feel his worth. He tries to keep an image of a ruthless and tough exterior, but in reality, he is kind-hearted. He easily gets embarrassed by compliments on his good acts. \n\n(Source: WIND BREAKER Official Website, edited)",
