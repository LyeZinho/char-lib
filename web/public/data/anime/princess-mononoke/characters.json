      "description": "**Relatives:** Unnamed parents, [Moro](https://anilist.co/character/9174/Moro) (adoptive mother)\n\nSan is the princess of the Wolf Gods. She acts, behaves, and resembles a wolf since she was raised by wolves. She is fundamentally defined by her appreciation of nature and hatred towards humans.\n\nSan is a young woman of average build who wears ragged clothing and a cape made of a wolf's fur and has what appears to be amaranth red war paint on her face. She wears a head necklace with a single small gem on her front. She also bears short, straight, earthy brown hair and has dark blue eyes with bangs slightly parted in the middle. She has a medium necklace with three fangs tied across her neck. She wears long, dangling, oval-shaped earrings during the whole film. She is also very agile, fast, fairly strong, and appears to be really good at using daggers and spears. She wears a mask which is her iconic feature. The mask is red with ears and white wavy lines and three sunshine yellow holes for a mouth and eyes. \n\nSan is depicted as stubborn, short-tempered, courageous, and protective - her primary concern is to protect the forest and animals she lives with. At first, she rejects her own humanity and is seen as misanthropic, thinking of herself only as a wolf. She initially only exhibits compassion towards the inhabitants of the forest but is able to accept and develop an admiration for others.\n\n(Source: Ghibli Wiki, edited)",

His only hope for a cure is to return to the forested land from which the boar-god originally came and discover what rage infected it. Leaving his people behind forever, he makes that journey and discovers the gods of the forest at war with the humans in a iron-mining town. Ashitaka vows to help the two sides reach a compromise, to cure them of the very anger that now eats away at him. The key to compromise appears to lie with a mysterious human girl who lives amongst the gods.",

She is well loved and respected by the townspeople, especially the women, as Eboshi is considered something of a hero in their eyes. She buys women originally sold to brothels in order to bring them to work for her, and even hires on lepers to make new kinds of ishibiya (hand canons introduced to Japan from China, though the new ones look more like rifles than canons). As such, Tatara Ba is basically considered to be a refuge for those who have nowhere else to go.!~",

When &quot;The Iron Works&quot; was established, Moro had a tendency to tell San to attack the villagers, since they were defiling the forest. One rainy day, Moro attacked the villagers, while Eboshi was there. Eboshi then used her iron gun, and shot Moro, making Moro lose her immortality.",
