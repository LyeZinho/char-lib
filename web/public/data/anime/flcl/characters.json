      "description": "Haruko Haruhara is Mabase's newest resident, and an extraterrestrial investigator for the Galactic Space Police Brotherhood.\n\nHaruko is an energetic, spontaneous girl with light-pinkish hair. She claims to be 19 years old, but it is impossible to know if that is true. In the first episode, she runs over [Naota](https://anilist.co/character/630/) with her Vespa and hits him in the head with her guitar. Shortly after, she becomes the Nandaba household's house-maid while working to find Atomsk, the most powerful space pirate in the galaxy.\n\nShe has a tendency to switch between a variety of different dispositions to others on a dime, making her difficult to read and unpredictable. She can be very persuasive and stand-offish sometimes to get what she wants. When around the Nandaba men, she is often either promiscuous or found in suggestive situations. She can also act like a mom, a lover or a maid depending upon her mood.\n\n~!She leaves Earth in the final episode of [FLCL](https://anilist.co/anime/227/), but returns as a teacher in Mabase in [FLCL Progressive](https://anilist.co/anime/21746/). In [FLCL Alternative](https://anilist.co/anime/21748/), she's back on Earth again tackling a whole host of new Medical Mechanica problems.!~",

      "description": "Twelve-year-old Naota Nandaba is the main character. His name is derived from the Japanese word for &quot;honesty&quot; and his father named him Naota because of that (Fooly Cooly). Unbeknownst to him, he has the &quot;right kind of head&quot; to be used as an N.O. channel. He is obsessed with appearing mature and attempts to act nonchalant. This is most expressed in his monologues which open and close each episode where he continues to claims that &quot;nothing amazing ever happens here&quot; despite the show&#039;s surreal and often absurd happenings. Naota idolizes his older brother Tasuku, carrying around Tasuku&#039;s baseball bat, and even hanging out with Tasuku&#039;s old girlfriend Mamimi. In Naota&#039;s mind, Tasuku is the epitome of what it means to be an adult, as opposed to the other adults in his life (e.g. his father, his grandfather, and his teacher) who he perceives as being immature. Much like Amarao, Naota is picky about his drinks (disliking drinks which are sour, bitter, or contain pulp) and hates spicy foods (note thought, he is told to &quot;cut back on the sour drinks&quot; by Amarao). His guitar is the Gibson Flying V which Haruko pulls out of his head in the fourth episode.     ~!While at the beginning of the series he appears to be bothered by Haruko&#039;s presence, over the course of the series he realizes his own feelings and admits that he loves her in the final episode. As Mamimi is his symbol of childhood, and Haruko is his symbol of adulthood, when they both leave Mabase, he is left right in the middle where he belongs, in adolescence. !~",

      "description": "Mamimi Samejima is a truant high school student with a quixotical grip on reality who carries a camera and smokes most of the time, hinted to have been bullied at her school and apparently from a broken family as her parents are mentioned are separated or are out of her life. She was originally Tasuku's girlfriend since he saved her from a elementary school fire, which she apparently caused due to her pyromaniacal tendencies to burn things she hates like her old school. It became a ritualistic practice for her in worshipping her personal deity Cantido whom she considered Canti an incarnation of. While Mamimi conceals her destructive nature, her aura of benign morbidness does make her an outcast in the eyes of others, save Naota who had a crush on her. Most characters refer to Mamimi simply as Mamimi, but Naota's friends refer to her as \"Naota's wife\", and Haruko calls her \"Sameji\", a shortening of her last name. Amarao refers to her as \"that high school girl\".\n\nHer relationship with Tasuku was ultimately based on caring for those who are dependent on her, having a habit of naming things \"Ta-Kun\" like a black kitten, and leaving them the moment that show any independence. Mamimi entered a sort of relationship with Naota as a means of coping with Tasuku having left for America and getting a new girlfriend, calling him \"Ta-Kun\" before he realized she was using him and emotionally explodes about her using him as a consolation prize during the events of Brittle Bullet while vowing to win her love. But a disillusioned Mamimi instead found a Medical Mechanica terminal core which she named \"Ta-Kun\", used it to enact retribution against those who have wronged her by feeding it her classmates' cellular phones and motorbikes before it goes berserk while enacting its program. It is revealed that Mamami, unable to return Naota's feelings despite having a genuine affection for him, leaves Mabase to become a professional photographer.",

After having his head broken by Haruko he is recruited by her as an assistant, however he proves to be no good for much other than washing dishes and fetching drinks for the family. It is later revealed that Atomsk can manifest through him, with Naota being the catalyst. Atomsk&#039;s symbol appears on Canti&#039;s screen when he absorbs Naota; the symbol is a corruption of the kanji characters for &quot;adult&quot; (��l). This symbol also appears on him when Naota &quot;swings the bat&quot; in Full Swing and when Canti is absorbed by the terminal core in FLCLimax. \n\nThe emotions of Canti are very human-like, despite his looks. He is embarrassed about his broken head (where Haruko hit him) and is looking for the pieces to glue back together in episode two. He wears the box on the back of his head for the same reason- shame. He is also extremely polite, extending a helping hand to Lieutenant Kitsurubami even after she attempted to destroy him.   \n\nCanti also dons a halo and fake wings (which Haruko was wearing in early episode two). Mamimi is convinced that Canti is an angel. She calls him Lord Canti after &quot;The God of Black Flames&quot; in a video game she plays. The rest of the cast call him by this title throughout the rest of the series. Apparently, he can also eat curry with his &quot;mouth,&quot; but it is never really explained how.",

Ninamori has N.O. powers as well: Naota's third robot, which appears at first as \"cat ears\" transfers to her instantly in the 3rd episode, while the two of them are fighting, as the Medical Factory's siren blows. She projects a proper, even slightly stuck-up personality, and conceals personal information to an almost obsessive degree; she does not even let her classmates know that she needs corrective lenses, instead wearing contacts while at school. Even with her class president status, however, Eri isn't above breaking the rules to get what she wants. She rigs the voting during the casting for the school play in order to get the lead role and have Naota cast opposite her, which (along with letting him see her wearing glasses) hints at her crush on Naota. Other hints are her expressed dislike of Mamimi and a final scene with Naota by a vending machine that mirrors Mamimi and Naota's early-series interactions. Ninamori is highly intelligent, if a little jaded. Much like Naota, Ninamori attempts to act mature, and although her parents' problems trouble her deeply, she refuses to admit it until near the end of the series.",

      "description": "Commander Amarao works for the department of Interstellar Immigration. This agency, among other things, acts as a middle man for negotiations between the government and Medical Mechanica. Thus, Haruko/Raharu is a big problem for them as she is bent on provoking an attack by disrupting communications. Amarao has fake eyebrows made of nori which he believes serve the dual purpose of making him look macho and protecting him from N.O. Amarao seems to have had a past relationship with Haruko similar to Naota's.    In the first episode he appears in (the 4th episode of the series), the viewers get the impression that he is virtually an omniscient character, giving background information as well as making fairly accurate predictions. However, subsequent events would show him as extremely weak and very limited in foresight.    It is a likely inference from the story that as a child he was approached by Haruko/Raharu, just like Naota, and she tried using his N.O. to contact/capture Atomsk. However, his N.O. channel is so weak that he can barely pull something the size of a slingshot through. When the prior happens in episode 5, Haruko says \"Small, as usual.\", again suggesting a previous relationship between the two, or that she has tried it with other men. One could also argue that a youthful entanglement with Haruko could have led to his career with Interstellar Immigration. There are some traces of him feeling jealous that Haruko has chosen Naota over him.    He has a love of sickeningly sweet candy and drinks, and hates spicy, sour, and pulpy foods - much like Naota. His vehicle of choice is a Fuji Rabbit, a motor scooter which was produced initially in 1946 six months prior to the initial production of the Vespa. Given that throughout the series Amarao is constantly trying to impress Haruko, who rides a Vespa, one could conclude his ownership of a scooter is further manifestation of his attempts to impress her - or at very least a signal to the level at which Haruko influenced him in his youth.",

In fact, Kitsurubami seems to be generally disgusted by the idea of romantic involvement (and likely any form of physical contact) with Amarao (she freaks out when she accidentally drinks from Amarao's water container), though she looks up to him as a superior and follows his orders loyally. She also seems to become smitten with Canti, despite her initial efforts to attack him with a 50 caliber sniper rifle.    Kitsurubami is named after a light brown traditional Japanese color, which happens to be the color of her skin. Thus, her name could be interpreted as &quot;Lieutenant Brown&quot;, although the color Kitsurubami is not the common &quot;brown.&quot; She appears to be the only &quot;normal&quot; (or mature) adult in FLCL.",

Kamon has taken a liking to Haruko, but she only wants to use him as an N.O. Portal.

The real Kamon is found dead in a cabinet but is brought back to life by being hydrated in a small bathtub. Haruko&#039;s true intentions of coming to Mabase are revealed through her interactions with Kamon. After realizing that his head didn&#039;t open the N.O. portal, she discards him and returns to using Naota, saying &quot;you&#039;re the only one who works&quot;. Like the other adults in FLCL, Kamon is extremely immature, normally more so than the other adults. But he shows a surprising amount of seriousness and thoughtfulness at some points in the anime",
