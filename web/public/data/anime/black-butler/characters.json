However, they are also the Queen's watchdogs; the Phantomhive family keeps an eye on black market dealings in ways that Scotland Yard isn't able to. Ciel Phantomhive is the heir to this legacy.  Earl Ciel Phantomhive is the business-savvy, twelve-year-old (later thirteen-year-old) head of the English Phantomhive noble family, taking over after the deaths of his parents, Lord Vincent and Lady Rachel Phantomhive. He also runs Funtom Company, which manufactures toys and sweets, and later adds a food branch after winning a Royal Warrant. His right eye, which is usually covered with a black eyepatch, bears a pentacle sign of the Faustian contract which binds the demon Sebastian Michaelis to his will. He also has a brand burnt into his back from when he was sold as a slave after his house was burnt down. Ciel is engaged to his cousin, Elizabeth Middleford. He sees her as an important friend and someone he needs to protect. His parents were killed and his mansion was set ablaze on his birthday, a reason why he does not like to celebrate the occasion. This tragedy causes him to not want to lose anyone important again. Despite his young age, he runs the family company and, as such, is quite busy much of the time though he still finds time to go out investigating dubious legal matters.   \n\nThroughout the series, Ciel's height has been used as a tool of mockery due to his short stature. He grows by 6 cm in the second season, but still remains shorter than the other characters, thus continuing the comical relief. Sebastian enjoys teasing Ciel about this fact. In the manga he does not grow taller.  The young earl is far more composed and mature than would be expected. He remains distant from others, aloof, preferring to spend his time on work for the company.  He is oftentimes selfish and not able to fully empathize with people. However, he does express occasional concern for the well-being of those close to him.  As a side note, Ciel seems to enjoy drinking tea a lot (he is adept at distinguishing between them as well) and sweet desserts. He has asthma (inherited from his mother) and dislikes being around cats because they trigger his allergies.",

Mostly, she tends to hang around the edges of the scene, fretting over the socially unacceptable things that her mistress continually gets up to. When something is not up to Madam Red's exacting standards, she takes it out on Grell whether or not it's actually her fault. Her tea is said to be far inferior to Sebastian's. Meek, easily scandalized, and highly nervous, Grell's personality is entirely at odds with her mistress's. As a result, the other characters tend to either ignore or walk all over her.   ~!This mild personality is entirely a facade. Grell's true identity is that of a death god; one with a true personality just as flamboyant as Madam Red's, perhaps even more so. The real Grell is a cheerful sadist who enjoys flirting and bloody murder, sometimes at the same time. She meets Madam Red during a night where she murders one of her patients and is attracted to her--both because her favorite color is red and because of her issues regarding childbirth. (Grell confesses to her that she, too, wishes that she could bear a child. But is unable to, being biologically male.) Grell refers to herself with feminine pronouns and has more than a passing interest in Sebastian; at one point she compares the two of them to Romeo and Juliet during their battle (leaving Sebastian horrified). Though having an interest in Sebastian, it was stated that Grell's 'true love' is William. Overall, she appears to have a tenuous grasp on sanity at best, switching from childish irritation to murderous rage at the drop of a hat. Like a typical death god, Grell possesses a scythe; however, she had it transformed into a chainsaw because she considered a regular scythe to be old-fashioned. Grell explains that her scythe is capable of cutting through anything; when it cuts through a person, it divides their soul and their memories, thus resulting in that person's memories playing before their eyes.!~",

      "description": "He was the head of the Phantomhive family and handsome enough to attract the attention of both Rachel and her sister Angelina, though he favored the older, more refined sister. It's because of his compliments on her red hair that Angelina originally began wearing red. Though he appears in several flashbacks, his face is never shown. He and Rachel were killed on Ciel's tenth birthday.   ~!Vincent was a handsome, well-dressed man with short, dark hair, a mole under his left eye and a kind smile. He bares a vague resemblance to Sebastian Michaelis.  When alive, he was shown to be exceptionally kind and welcoming. This was demonstrated when he noticed that Angelina is self-conscious of her red hair and he made a point to compliment it. He also welcomed Baron Kelvin in to his home, and always took a minute to spare a greeting and a kind word, while others of his social status looked on with disdain. People were shown to have been easily drawn to him, as Angelina fell in love with him easily, and as a child, Ciel accompanied Vincent whenever he could, even when still recovering from being ill.  He was a loving father and his family was always very important to him.  However, he was just as capable as Ciel at manipulating individuals, and Baron Kelvin took note of him and his acquaintances as being \"evil noblemen.\" It is shown that Undertaker was acquainted with the Phantomhive family when Vincent was the head. Another is shown in chapter 75 when he gets a \"German dog\" which he had a bet with.  Vincent was the head of the Phantomhive household and acted as Queen Victoria's watchdog, both titles that Ciel later took over. Tanaka has shown to have worked for the Phantomhive family at least since Vincent's time.  Sometime while he was alive, he hosted a variety of parties that many others nobles attended. When Baron Kelvin attended one of these parties, it is the first time that he encountered Ciel, and he made a continued effort to network with Vincent after that. While Vincent was kind, the others were not, causing Baron Kelvin to believe he had to be more \"beautiful\" to be accepted by their social circle. As a result, Vincent is indirectly part of the reason for Baron Kelvin's obsession with undergoing plastic surgery and with Ciel.  On Ciel's tenth birthday, Vincent and his wife were killed in a fire, his son was kidnapped, and his manor was burnt to the ground. It seems that the reason for this was related to his work as the queen's watchdog and his control over the underworld. In the anime, his death is directly attributed to Queen Victoria.!~",

      "description": "Ciel's mother was patient and kind, with an elegant kind of poise occasionally shattered by her propensity to tease her younger sister into being more self-confident. She cared deeply for Angelina and took care of her after her accident. Everything points to her having been a good wife and loving mother, though as with her husband, not much is known about her, though her face is visible in flashbacks.",
