Just like Glass, he has a warrior spirit which is shown during his fight with Naofumi.\n\nHe is a good judge of character just by looking at someone. He did have a childish side which shown by the way, when he acted too excited for the ship ride to Cal Mira island. He had the habit of calling the younger persons \"Kiddo\". He has high morals and doesn't want to hurt any others who are irrelevant to his mission.",
