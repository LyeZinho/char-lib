Has yet to be shown opening his eyes and is always seen with his rabbit puppet. Not much is known about him he also did not contribute to the group effort in the Exwire exam. However, when he speaks with his rabbit puppet, the voice and tone is usually very rude.",

Ukobach is proud of his cooking skills, but also fiercely protective of his food and his domain, the dorm kitchen. As such he was enraged at Rin for using the dorm kitchen without his permission and for a while he refused to cook for the brothers. He also tried to cook 3 girls for ruining his lunch for Rin and Yukio. He is often silent, but Rin has been able to communicate with the little demon and the two get along well due to their mutual love of cooking.",
