She is a young girl who Twilight finds at an orphanage. Believing her to be a smart child, he decides to adopt her for his mission. What he doesn't know is that Anya is an esper who escaped from the Lab that gave her the power to read minds. Starving for excitement in her life after spending most of it so far in a lab, Anya actively sought to be the one adopted by Loid and then make sure Loid and Yor got together, so she could have a spy and assassin for parents. Anya is the only Forger aware of just about everyone's Secret Identities, but keeps it to herself out of fear that if her psychic powers are exposed she'll be put in a lab again.",
