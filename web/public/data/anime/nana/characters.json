Ren is a big fan of the Sex Pistols; he participated in a tribute album to them, and wears a &quot;Sid Vicious&quot; padlock around his neck that he received from Nana. Nana had an image of a lotus tattooed on her upper arm in honor of him (&quot;Ren&quot; is a Japanese name for lotus). The brand of the cigarettes he originally smoked was the &#039;Seven Stars&#039;.\n\nNana first met him through Nobu, who really just admired him from afar. Ren was popular around their hometown for supposedly being found as a baby in an abandoned warehouse, which he lives in to this day. He isn&#039;t ashamed of this; he actually brags about it. Ren and Nana are proven to be very similar throughout the series, but they are not totally similar. Ren seems to be more open with his love for Nana, being able to ask for her back and her hand in marriage while those thoughts just made Nana want to yell at him. Ren also really would like a family and child, while Nana really dislikes the concept because she doesn&#039;t want to be the dependent wife who makes miso soup for her husband all day.\n\n~!Later on in the series, Ren develops a drug addiction and his life starts to spiral out of control. Shortly after begging his manager for more drugs, on his knees, quivering in pain from withdrawal, he dies from a car crash. Reporters were following him and happened to see him suddenly swerve into a building, which happened to be where he&#039;s lived in all of his life. No one is really sure if it was a suicide attempt or accidental.!~",

Despite his raw sexual charisma, Takumi can also be a cold and controlling workaholic. His favorite brand of cigarettes is Gitanes.    ~!Coming from a family with an alcoholic and bitter father, he and his older sister learned to be independent at a young age due to their mother being bed-ridden with illness in the hospital. He looked after Layla since they were children and always harbored a brother-like care for her. He ends up dating and sleeping with Hachi, which dubiously resulted in Hachi's pregnancy. For some reason, perhaps because of his family background or because he is starting to become possessive, he refuses to leave Hachi and the unborn child despite Hachi's uncertainty whether it is his or Nobu's. In a previous chapter, Naoki said something to Yasu about Takumi not letting the woman he is infatuated with run away that easily; and Ren saying that Takumi hates getting into such mess, which hints that Takumi took responsibility not just only because of sheer sense of responsibility but he is starting to care for her. But although he loves Hachi and is \"infatuated\" with her, Takumi still keeps his playboy habits, cheating on her first with a soap-opera actress and later on with Reira, who has openly declared her desire to become his lover.  In the end, Takumi is one of the most confusing characters in this manga. Like what Hachiko once said, with Takumi, it is hard to tell whether it is love or business.!~",
