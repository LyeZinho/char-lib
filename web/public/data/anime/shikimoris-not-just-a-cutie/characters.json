She is very protective of Izumi because he always puts himself in risky situations, when these situations occur, Shikimori reveals her \"cool\" appearance. She thinks Izumi is very cool and kind. She owns a pet dog named Kara.\n\nBoth cute and cool clothing styles suit her, but she seem to have a preference for a cute look. She became very popular at school with the girls after they saw her cool side during the tournament's volleyball game.",
