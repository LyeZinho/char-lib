  "description": "The novel's story is set 16 years after the \"Law for Public Order and Morals in Healthy Child-Raising\" banned coarse language in the country. Tanukichi Okuma enrolls in the country's leading elite public morals school and is soon invited into the Anti-Societal Organization (SOX) by its founder, Ayame Kajou. As a member blackmailed into joining by Ayame, Tanukichi ends up taking part in obscene acts of terrorism against the talented student council president Anna (for whom Tanukichi has a crush).\n\n(Source: Anime News Network)",
