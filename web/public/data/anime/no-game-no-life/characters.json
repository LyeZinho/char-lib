      "description": "__Race:__ Human\n\nAbandoned by his parents, Sora is a brilliant NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) hikikomori (shut-in) gamer along with his stepsister, Shiro. He does not take life very seriously and is pretty much a good-for-nothing gamer. One day, he and his sister are called into an alternate world and they have to become Saviors of Humanity! \n\nDespite being a NEET and a shut-in, Sora is extremely outgoing and confident, and is not afraid to play games with people face to face, even when they're cheating. He is also extremely manipulative - which he refers to as using negotiating skills. This fits in with his play style as while Shiro is excellent at logic and computing, Sora can read people and predict what their next move is, using this knowledge to beat them. \n\nHowever, if he is separated from Shiro by so much as a closed door he becomes a spineless, cowardly wreck, and only returns to his former self if he is able to see her. He views his sister as his equal and partner, but is also protective of her, shown by actions such as putting his body between her and the ground when he thought they were going to hit hard when first arriving on Disboard.\n\nSora is extroverted and has no problems dealing with people. While not as intelligent as Shiro, he is shown to have a brilliant IQ. Rather than computing numbers like Shiro, Sora can rapidly compute what his opponents are going to do based on observing their behavior and motivations.\n\nSora is also slightly perverted and desires a girlfriend for himself. His lust lead to a linguistic mistake that causes Stephanie to fall in love with him and causes him to receive a scolding from Shiro.\n\n(Source: No Game No Life Wikia)",

After the war, she passed the law in which Flügel shared books among each other.\n\nAzriel has a somewhat split personality, being peppy and bubbly to a cold, relentless state. Prior to Jibril's creation, Azriel was merciless and considered other Flügel expendable; afterwards, however, she turned into a sister figure when Jibril came to be. Even so, she continues to have a condescending attitude towards lower exceed races. She is extremely powerful as the first Flügel to be created, being able to pull off many feats. This is further enhanced by her mental connection with Avant Heim, while also being its representative. Even with her strength, Jibril considers Azriel to be rather stupid compared to other Flügel. Despite this, Azriel is clever when it comes to mind games and deception. What she lacks is an understanding of learning, trying, and failing; preventing her from learning from her mistakes.",
