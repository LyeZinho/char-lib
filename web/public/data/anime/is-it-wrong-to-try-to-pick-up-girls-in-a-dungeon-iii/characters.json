She is a hard worker, and works jobs to support the two while Bell goes off to the dungeon. Hestia tends to be shown as very petty and gets jealous easily when girls, namely Aiz, show interest in Bell, because she is deeply in love with him, or they are the reason for his strength growth. Despite seeming mature and dependable toward Bell, Hestia is in truth, a lazy goddess, as she couldn't get a job or put effort into work. After descending to the Lower World, Hestia was taken care of by her friend Hephaestus. Soon after, she was asked to live on her own after she kept freeloading off of Hephaestus' familia and was given a room at an abandoned church. Hestia tried to create her own familia, but wasn't able to recruit anyone. After failing to recruit for the 50th time, she noticed Bell and decided to secretly follow him. Hestia found out that Bell had been trying to enter a familia, but was rejected multiple times and seemed to be in the same boat. Hestia then took the chance to recruit him, which Bell happily agreed upon; becoming the first member of her familia. She took Bell to a bookstore, the location she already decided beforehand, and granted her Falna to her first dependent.",

      "description": "__Race:__ Human\n__Height:__ 165 cm (5'5\")\n\nBell Cranel is the captain of the Hestia Familia. Bell was raised by his grandfather in a rural farming village deep within the mountains near the labyrinth city Orario. He had heard and read many stories about heroes from his grandfather, forming his dream of aspiring to be a mighty one himself. After his grandfather's death, he took it upon himself to leave the village, traveling to the land of Orario to fulfill his dreams. Upon his arrival in the city, Bell attempted to enter numerous Familia, but was rejected by each one. Hestia, a Goddess, unable to find members willing to join her Familia, asked him if he'd like to become the first member of her Familia. Bell gladly accepted, and so started his new life, finally with a Goddess' blessing.\n\nBell is a kind, straightforward, brave, yet shy boy who desires to be a hero like the ones he grew up reading about. He cares deeply for the people around him, especially his Goddess, Hestia, and his Familia. He considers them like family due to the death of his grandfather. Bell's goals didn't start out pure, as he wanted to be an adventurer in hopes of picking up girls, even thinking of starting a harem. However, after his experience with Ais and Bete, Bell seems to have forgone that dream and fell in love with Ais Wallenstein. He became determined to grow stronger so that he could be someone that could stand beside her. Ais saved Bell in an incident with a minotaur and that event made Bell fall in love with her and have fear of Minotaurs.",

Originally a member of the Soma Familia, she converted to the Hestia Familia after securing her freedom after the War Game. Lili was born to Hobbit parents belonging to the Soma Familia, making her a member of the Familia from birth. However, her parents didn't look after her and ordered her to earn money for them instead. A while later, her parents were killed in the dungeon, leaving her to fend for herself. The Soma Familia didn't take care of her and bullied her, making her lonely and isolated. To earn money, she tried to be an adventurer, but didn't have the talent, eventually switching to being a supporter. As a supporter, she was constantly looked down on by those she partied with, fueling the hatred of adventurers inside of her. After a while, Lili decided to run away from the Soma Familia and become a normal citizen. However, the Soma Familia found her and inflicted misery on the old couple who took care of her, destroying their store and stealing money. She began to hate Soma himself, wondering why he created a Familia if he wasn't going to take care of it. From that time on, Lili began using her hatred of adventurers as an excuse to trick and steal from them. \n\nShe also treated Bell the same way, however, his actions repeatedly caused her to question her own attitude. After she is saved by Bell, she becomes much closer to him and develops romantic feelings for him. Lili often uses her experience to gather information or do jobs that Bell and the other members of the Hestia Familia would be unable to do properly. She is also frequently amazed at how Bell seems to constantly get himself involved in trouble, yet she still cooperates with him in whatever he does.\n\nLili is regarded as the \"brains\" of the Familia, being that she is the most capable when it comes to developing battle plans and strategies. She advised Bell and Welf to travel to the eighteenth floor when they were trapped in the dungeon, and she was crucial in forming the Hestia Familia's plan of attack for the War Game. Lili also possesses a strong insight, forged through her time as a thief, as she was able to pick up Finn Deimne's speech patterns, mannerisms, and character after only one meeting with him.",

Haruhime grew up as a dignified young lady of a noble family in the Far East. Living in solitude, her home was like a cage and she had no friends. At some point, children of the Takemikazuchi Familia, with the approval of their God, started taking her outside at night to play with them. Sometime later, someone framed her for eating an offering, which angered her father so much that he disowned her and a Pallum guest offered to take her away. As they were traveling, they were attacked by monsters and the Pallum ran away, leaving Haruhime behind. She survived, but was later captured by bandits and sold to a brothel in Orario. While heading there, she caught the eye of Ishtar, who bought her. Haruhime became a member of the Ishtar Familia, where she was forced to work as a prostitute, until the Familia disbanded.\n\nHaruhime is a gentle, timid, well-mannered, and extremely kind girl. She is respectful of everyone she meets and is eager to help when given the chance. Having grown up mostly isolated and later kept hidden by the Ishtar Familia, Haruhime has experienced quite a sheltered life. And as such, even minor things will excite her. Haruhime developed a love of reading at a young age, as it was her way of escaping her loneliness. She has a fondness for fairy tales, particularly ones where the hero saves a damsel in distress. When she was made to work as a prostitute, she wished that a hero would come and save her like in those stories. As time went on, however, she convinced herself that she wouldn't be saved since she believed that her profession made her unworthy of rescue. However, Haruhime's view on this changed after Bell saved her regardless of her beliefs. Though she has never had to fend for herself, Haruhime displays an unusual sense of bravery when those she cares for are threatened. When Wiene was in danger, Haruhime leaped off a building in pursuit of her and stood up to Bete in order to give Bell enough time to escort Wiene to safety.\n\nWhile working as a prostitute, Haruhime would foam at the mouth and collapse whenever she saw a naked man. Due to this, she is still a virgin, but is unaware of the fact.",

She is also fond of hero stories and is almost equally as knowledgeable about the topic as Bell is. She also seems to be more caring than her sister, as seen when she let Wiene live.",

Mord Latro is a loud and tough adventurer. He is also shown to be ill-tempered, holding a grudge against Bell for his rapid growth and fame. He is also shown to have a lustful nature, claiming that Bell should share Ryuu, Syr, and Lili while at the Hostess of Fertility because \"they were friends\". Despite Mord's dislike for Bell at first due to his growth and fame, he comes to respect Bell after his battle with him on the 18th floor, as well as witnessing Bell finish off the Floor Boss Black Goliath. Through various encounters, such as the El Dorado Resort incident, he also becomes much friendlier to him, even coming to his defense when an adventurer insulted him for helping monsters. He even bet 100,000 valis on the Hestia Familia during the War Game, showing his confidence in their abilities.",

He was the former captain of the Vidar Familia until they left the city. Bete was born to the leader of a clan of Werewolves and had a sister named Luna along with a childhood friend named Rene, who he later got in a relationship with. However, his whole clan was killed by a monster when he was 12, and he traveled to Orario where he eventually became the captain of the Vidar Familia. When he was 16, he temporarily left the city as a Level 3 to kill the monster that killed his clan, succeeding in doing so after a day of fighting. Unfortunately, he discovered upon his return that his Familia had failed their recent dungeon expedition, resulting in the deaths of the vice-captain, who he used to be in a relationship with, along with several others while others that survived gained wounds fatal for an adventurer. The Vidar Familia subsequently left the city, though he stayed behind, and later joined the Loki Familia after an incident with Finn and Gareth at a pub.\n\nBete has a rough personality and a slight superiority complex. He completely hates the weak, especially those that don't do anything about their weakness, and is not afraid to express his opinions about it. He can be an idiot who can't read the atmosphere. Furthermore, he is a bad drunk and has a tendency to spout things when intoxicated. He has, in several instances, displayed feats of heroism and still worries for the wellbeing of his weaker subordinates. He is also described as a tsundere, hiding a more forebearing exterior. He admires and has a crush on Ais.",

She is the older twin of the Hiryute Sisters. Tione and Tiona were born in Telskyura and were forced to join the Kali Familia from the moment they were born. Both sisters didn't know who their parents were, but knew that they were sisters. She reached Level 2 on her fifth birthday after she unknowingly killed Seldas, a person that she had viewed as a mother and an older sister, in a daily fight to the death, resulting in her resentment of Telskyura. Soon after, both sisters became students to Argana and Bache. The day before Tione's seventh birthday, Tiona asked Kali to let them leave the country, which she granted a couple of days later, much to their surprise. The sisters traveled across the land, temporarily joining different Familia for a year, during which both sisters reached Level 3. They arrived at Orario years later when they were 12 years old. After agreeing to join the Familia of the adventurer that defeated them, they proceeded to defeat everyone that challenged them, only to lose to Finn and Gareth when they were challenged by the Loki Familia. Upon her defeat, Tione fell in love with Finn, and desperately tried to make herself into a woman he would like. Following a dungeon expedition they went on shortly after joining, both sisters reached Level 4.\n\nTione is in love with Finn Deimne and gets angry when other women try to flirt with him. She used to use dirty language, but cleaned it up after meeting Finn. However, her language returns to normal whenever she gets angry.",
