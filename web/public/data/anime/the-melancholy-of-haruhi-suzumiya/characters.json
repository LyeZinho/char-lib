      "description": "**Height:** 152 cm (5 ft)\n**Occupation:** Student (grade 11-12), SOS Deputy Vice Commander, ~!Time Traveler!~\n\nMikuru Asahina, a shy and timid girl with a childish naïveté, is the only character other than [Kyon](https://anilist.co/character/252/Kyon) to be brought into the SOS Brigade against her will. Considered one of the most beautiful girls in high school, Mikuru is as kind, caring and thoughtful as she is beautiful. She easily gets scared or flustered, and is apparently prone to daydreaming as she can also be rather clumsy at times. Nevertheless, she can be surprisingly resilient and is capable of recovering from even the most discomforting of situations. However, because of her gentle nature she seems rather helpless most of the time. Kyon sees it as his duty to always watch over and protect her, although, when it comes to [Haruhi](https://anilist.co/character/251/Haruhi-Suzumiya), there is no rescue. \n\n~!She is in fact a time traveller from the future with the purpose of observing Haruhi during the course of the story line. Mikuru often has trouble talking to Kyon because many of the things he asks about revolving around her powers are \"classified\". Mikuru's future self occassionally shows up as well, in order to properly guide the timeline to the correct path, and is notably more mature and knowledgeable than her past self. In order to differentiate between the older and younger versions, whenever the older self is present in the same time span, Kyon refers to her older self as Asahina-san (Big) and to the younger Asahina as Asahina-san (Small).\n\nMikuru is the designated \"mascot\" of the SOS Brigade, serving as a way to attract interest and members by using her attractive physical qualities- her cute face, trim figure, and noticeably sizeable bust. She was \"voluntarily arrested\" by Haruhi, who deemed it necessary to have an alluring \"Moe\" type in the club. Her sex appeal and innocence is often exploited by Haruhi to procure resources. Mikuru is on a regular occasion forced to wear any outfits that Haruhi buys for her. Haruhi also sees it fit that Mikuru is unable to dress and undress by herself most times and often does it for her, much to Mikuru's considerable - and vocal - distress.!~",

Itsuki is constantly smiling and always speaks in a formal and polite manner. He is also prone to giving long and detailed explanations, usually illustrated by exaggerated hand gestures. Itsuki's fondness for speculation often causes him to produce explanations for situations involving the SOS Brigade, its members and related events. Itsuki only tends to share these explanations and theories with [Kyon](https://anilist.co/character/252/Kyon), and also enthusiastically plays different kinds of board games with him to pass the time, despite losing all the time, although Kyon suspects that he may be doing so on purpose. \n\n~!Itsuki is an Esper, and was sent to observe and keep Haruhi emotionally stable by a mysterious group known as \"The Agency\", in order to protect the rest of humanity. Although he is an esper, which is exactly one of the sorts of people Haruhi desires to meet, Itsuki never reveals himself as such, at least, not to her. Despite the theory he advances in which Haruhi is the equivalent of God, Itsuki says that there are many differing lines of speculation about Haruhi within \"The Agency.\" Itsuki himself does not believe in a singular God, nor does he regard Haruhi as such, although he reveals that he has colleagues that do. Apparently, most of the questions that he raises about Haruhi's true nature are philosophical in nature and do not necessarily represent his personal beliefs. Itsuki also reveals that the majority of \"The Agency\" advocates observing Haruhi instead of doing anything that might provoke her.   \n\nOut of the three Brigade members, Kyon is the least fond of Itsuki. He often finds himself annoyed with Itsuki's plastic smile, his willingness to acquiesce to Haruhi's outrageous schemes, playful teasing and his various forays into his psychological and philosophical theories. He is also distrustful of Itsuki's intentions, comparing him to [Yuki Nagato](https://anilist.co/character/249/Yuki-Nagato) when it comes to deciphering his expressions.!~",
