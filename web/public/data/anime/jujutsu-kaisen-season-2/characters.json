His body was able to be split up into 20 cursed objects because he received assistance from Kenjaku.!~\n\nSukuna is hedonistic and has no regard for the suffering of others, believing that suffering is natural for the weak. He is selfish, and always wants to stay in control of the situation without caring about the consequences.",
