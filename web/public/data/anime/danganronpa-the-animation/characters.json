However, after realizing it is real, he turns much more panicky and he is generally considered useless by the other students. However, he does treat his fellow classmates with general friendliness, going so far as to add the suffix \"-chi\", an affectionate term for dear friends in Japanese, to the end of everyone's last name (except for Sakura Ogami, whom he is afraid of and just calls with the insulting nickname \"Ogre\").\n\n(Source: Danganronpa Wiki)",
