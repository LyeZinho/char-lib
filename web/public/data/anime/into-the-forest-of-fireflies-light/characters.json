After helping her out of the forest, Hotaru stated that she will return to give him a gift. From then on, the two became close friends and met each other every summer.   ~!Gin was once a human, but died from being abandoned in the forest as a young baby. The mountain god cast a spell on Gin, allowing him to live. But since the spell casted upon him was fragile, if he ever touches the skin of a living human, the spell would break and he would disappear.!~",
