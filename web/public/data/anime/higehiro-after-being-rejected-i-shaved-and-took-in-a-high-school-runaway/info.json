  "description": "On his way home from drinking his sorrows away after being rejected by his crush, the 26 year old salaryman, Yoshida, finds a high school girl named Sayu sitting on the side of the road. Yoshida is completely drunk out of his mind and ends up letting Sayu stay at his place overnight. Not having the heart to put Sayu out on the streets since she ran away from home, Yoshida allows her to stay at his place... And so began the awkward, irritable, and slightly heartwarming relationship between a runaway high school girl and a salaryman living together.\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
