Despite his murderous intent, his hue has always been pure white.!~   \n\n~!According to Kogami, Makishima's pure Psycho-Pass is the result of having suffered hardships in his early life and that being \"unrecognized\" by Sibyl left Makishima feeling invisible, which may have triggered his single-minded goal of taking down the Sibyl System. Makishima, on the other hand, believes that isolation made him stronger.!~",

She explains that he was able to get away with it due to him having a condition known as being \"criminally asymptotic\", meaning that he could get scanned and have no problems found with him.  It is believed that Shogo Makishima possesses the same condition due to his immunity to the Dominator.  In Episode 16, after Shuusei and Gu-Song discover the true form of the Sybil System she appears to kill Gu-Song with the \"Lethal Elimiinator\". However, she is revealed to be a cyborg and then turns and shoots Shuusei before fading out, leaving thier fates unknown.   She is actually a robotic body that the members of the Sibyl System use to run the MWPSB. The body is nothing but a shell, used by the members to do their whims. It is only operational when one of their brains occupies her body.!~",
