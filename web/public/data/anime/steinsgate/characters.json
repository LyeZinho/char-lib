He acts like a villain​ but is rather immature as he frequently shows traits of Chuunibyou syndrome despite being a grown-up man. After enrolling in university, he established a laboratory in Akihabara named the \"Future Gadget Research Establishment\", where he invents gadgets which tend to be of little use. He often speaks to himself on his cellphone, often not making any sense. Supposedly, he has very few friends that can understand what he's talking about.\n\nThe phrase he uses to end conversations, particularly with himself, is \"El Psy Kongroo\" (エル・プサイ・コングルゥ).\n\nSteins;Gate:\n~!Eventually, he falls in love with, and confesses to, Makise Kurisu.!~\n\nSteins;Gate 0:\n~!In the future of the Alpha world line, Okabe became the leader of the resistance against SERN's rule, and was known as an international terrorist (in the side story \"The Distant Valhalla\", it's revealed that SERN released Okabe and Daru so that they could found the resistance, thus completing the cycle of fate). Okabe got captured by SERN's Rounder unit in 2025 and was tortured to death.!~",

Her age group matches that of third-year high schoolers, but she skipped a grade through America's educational system. She is also famous in America for writing theses papers, part of which is covered in the news. Thanks to skipping a grade in America as a girl, she was envied by people around her, and ended up building a strong personality. She does not want to show weakness to others, so she always has a stern expression. However, she is very curious, and when she builds interest, she pokes into things. Occasionally, she has views that differ from regular opinions, such as, \"The experiment data is more important than the subject's privacy.\" Rintarou often tells her, \"Hey, you've got a pretty good sense of being a Mad Scientist,\" but she is not one to agree to such things personally. She is a tsundere.",

She often went with her grandmother to see the stars on her grandmother's back.

Very helpful. A little too familiar with things, but doesn't dig too deep. Not quite comfortable with having other people help her. For that reason, she spends as little time as possible. Her personality drastically changes when it comes to her own interests. Proactive. Has a habit of using strange and difficult vocabulary at times, but somehow you can tell she's purposely doing so. Ended up hanging out with the Future Gadget Laboratory since she started working at the CRT TV Workshop.   \n\n~!It is revealed in Episode 14 that she came from the year 2036 to save the world from SERN's rule. Therefore, she used the name John Titor on Internet boards so that Okabe and the others would notice. She was the one who sent the time machine crashing into Akihabara in 2010, right when the Phone Microwave was being developed. This time machine, revealed to have been created by Daru, could only go back in time, but could never go to the future.  In order to find the IBN 5100, Suzuha decides to go back to 1975 and then bring it to Okabe to stop SERN. In deciding so, she would have to leave 2010 and wouldn't be able to come back. Dedicated to her mission, she decides to go. A few hours after her departure, Okabe and the others receive a letter from her, written in the year 2000. It revealed that she had failed to retrieve the PC, due to the time machine's malfunction, causing her to lose her memory until the year 2000. It was revealed by Mr. Braun that she had committed suicide that day, but thanks to the D-Mail Okabe sent, her death changed from suicide to illness. This caused the meter to raise its number, but not up to 1%.  In the Drama CD, it's revealed that after going back to 1975, she later became a professor in Akiha Yukitaka's and Nakabachi (then Makise Shouichi)'s university, and started their interest in the creation of a time machine.!~",

However, as Kurisu became more intrigued by his works, she started to learn by herself and soon surpassed him. When she was eleven, she was able to disprove his time machine theory, and the shame drove Nakabachi to cut off his relationship with her, and never gave her the 11th birthday present he bought, an incident he later confessed to Yukitaka that he deeply regretted.
