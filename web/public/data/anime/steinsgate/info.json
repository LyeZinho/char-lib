  "description": "Self-proclaimed mad scientist Okabe Rintarou lives in a small room in Akihabara, where he invents \"future gadgets\" with fellow lab members Shiina Mayuri, his air-headed childhood friend, and Hashida Itaru, an otaku hacker. The three pass the time by tinkering with their latest creation, a \"Phone Microwave\" that can be controlled through text messages. \n\nThe lab members soon face a string of mysterious incidents that lead to a game-changing discovery: the Phone Microwave can send emails to the past and thus alter history. Adapted from the critically acclaimed visual novel by 5pb. and Nitroplus, Steins;Gate takes Okabe to the depths of scientific theory and human despair as he faces the dire consequences of changing the past.",
