She became unable to make decisions by herself and repressed her emotions as a defense mechanism. In order to help rectify this, Kanae gave her a coin to flip to decide which path to follow when she didn't know what to do.\n\nLater on, Tanjiro helps Kanao overcome her indecisiveness and Kanao soon becomes more confident in making decisions with or without her coin.\n\nKanao and Tanjiro would eventually marry and start a family, having two great-great-grandchildren by the names of [Kanata Kamado](https://anilist.co/character/171144/Kanata-Kamado) and [Sumihiko Kamado](https://anilist.co/character/171145/Sumihiko-Kamado) between them.!~",
