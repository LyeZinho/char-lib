      "description": "__Race:__ God\n__Height:__ 174 cm (5’8”)\n__Occupation:__ God of War, Delivery God, God of Calamity (previously) \n\nYato is one of the three main protagonists of Noragami. An obscure god who considers himself a God of Fortune / Happiness and War, he has been labeled a God of Calamity and Depression in the past. Yato's dream is to become a famous god, whom everyone worships.\n\nYato can be mischievous, crude, and unpredictable in his behavior. He often has a low tolerance for something he wants, usually causing those around him to become upset. Furthermore, he is rather childish and gullible at times. Yato will often indulge in fantasies of being a very successful God with more followers than any other deity; shrines full of luxury and shrine maiden at his fingertips. As his existence would end if he were to be forgotten, he has developed Athazagoraphobia.\n\n~!It is revealed that Yato's real name is Yaboku (夜卜) Yaboku contains the kanji ya (夜 night) and boku (卜 divination). [Sakura](https://anilist.co/character/189754/Sakura) mistakenly read 卜 as the katakana ト to because of the similarities, thus giving the well-known alias name Yato.!~",

Despite being raised to be completely lady-like in a rich household, Hiyori is a huge martial arts fan and has a fixation on a martial artist called Touno, whom she adores and copies her attacks from. She often becomes inspired and acts on his words.\n\nHiyori is a very pure, kind-hearted, and brave girl who will go out of her way to help someone in danger, even strangers, regardless of the severe consequences, including suffering from blight. She has a strong moral compass and is not above calling people out if she feels their actions are wrong. Hiyori is also extremely perceptive of those around her, but despite that she can be a bit air-headed too. \n\nShe also has a strong liking to Yato's smell and even called it her favorite smell on one occasion, but she becomes rather embarrassed by how much she likes it and dodges the subject whenever it is brought up.",
