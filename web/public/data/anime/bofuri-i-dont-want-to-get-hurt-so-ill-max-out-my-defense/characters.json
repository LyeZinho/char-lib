      "description": "Maple is the main heroine, who has just started playing NewWorld Online. A shielder class. Since she doesn’t want to get hurt, she always puts her skill points into vitality. Due to this, many think of her as useless offensively, but much to their surprise, she manages her own. She's a bit silly, though surprisingly intelligent, and often abuses the game's mechanics in ways the game developers don't expect. Most of her actions in-game are done for the sole purpose of having fun, and though she participates in in-game tournaments often, she's only competitive insofar as it's enjoyable to her.",
