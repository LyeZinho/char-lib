After several meetings with Kotomi, Tomoya starts skipping the fourth period and spend time with Kotomi in the library. Tomoya decides to force Kotomi to join the drama club to make her more sociable.

Wanting to bring Kotomi away from her past, Tomoya decides to renovate her garden, while the drama club members decide to gift her a violin, but was unfortunately destroyed. After renovating Kotomi's garden, Kotomi appears to Tomoya, and after some poignant conversation, Tomoya brings Kotomi out of her house to see the outside world inside her heart. The next day, her guardian presents Kotomi her parent's briefcase that has traveled all the way to Japan, and inside is a teddy bear and a testimony, asking Kotomi to live the way she wants and grow up to be an adult. Kotomi realizes she is still being loved by her parents even after their death and cries. After this, Kotomi becomes more mature, and the drama club members finally give Kotomi a violin.!~    \n\n__In After Story__  \n~!In the anime adaptation Clannad After Story, Kotomi moves to America to further her studies.

      "description": "Yusuke is an electrician who once attended Tomoya's high school and lived as a rock musician. He is admired by Mei for his infrequent rock play. Tomoya first met Yusuke during a street light accident involving a person's car, and assists Yusuke in his work. Through Yusuke, he realizes the pain of working in society. Yusuke is engaged to Kouko, and is also one of the reasons why Fuko exists in the school.   Clannad After-Story:  ~! He plays a more prominent role in After Story, giving Tomoya a job as an assistant electrician in his company, and sometimes gives him advice. Due to Tomoya's interest in him, Yusuke tells him of his past - how he became a rock musician, rose in fame, and ended due to his loss of his original motivation, along with stress and drugs. After being rehabilitated, no one wanted him anymore, except for Kouko, who had encouraged him to become a rock musician during his high school days. Throwing away his past, he now works as an electrician. Realizing that there are people who still love his music through Tomoya, Yusuke decides to create another music CD that sings his love for the city.  !~",
