The name of the girl who teases, torments, and tantalizes Senpai is \"Nagatoro!\" She's annoying yet adorable. It's painful, but you still want to be by her side. This is a story about an extremely sadistic and temperamental girl and you'll feel something awaken inside of you.\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
