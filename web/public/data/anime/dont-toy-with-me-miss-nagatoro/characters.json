She seems to be a member of the Swimming Club. Nagatoro is an energetic, athletic, popular and rather sadistic - but deep down very sweet - girl, often referred to as a \"sadodere\". She is part of a 'cool kids' clique together with her friends [Gamo-chan](https://anilist.co/character/145715/Maki-Gamo), [Yoshi](https://anilist.co/character/145718/Yoshi) and [Sakura](https://anilist.co/character/145716/Sakura), and is a member of the swimming club, despite also having a liking for martial arts such as muay thai, boxing, capoeira and especially judo.\n\n~!Chapter 81 — there's major development between Nagatoro & [Naoto](https://anilist.co/character/124697/Naoto-Hachiouji) which reveals that Nagatoro is supposedly interested romantically in him and sets out a dare to get a kiss from him as a reward for beating her judo rival [Orihara](https://anilist.co/character/220340/Orihara)!~",

Naoto spends his time after school in the art club with Nagatoro on most days where the crazy antics ensue. He is an introvert, twitchy, loner, nerdy and shy aspiring artist, who tries to avoid social interaction with other people and doesn't seem to have any friends. He is also referred as closet-perv by Nagatoro.\n\n~!Naoto eventually notices his romantic feelings for [Nagatoro](https://anilist.co/character/124696/Hayase-Nagatoro) and sets out different scenarios to get closer with her and date her in the future.!~",
