Although [Meme Oshino](https://anilist.co/character/22552/Meme-Oshino) helped him become human again, there are a few lingering side effects; he can see in the dark and far distances, and he heals faster than the average human.

She is always seen dressed in the uniform of Naoetsu Private High School, even outside of school days, and is rarely seen on any other type of clothing, except for a set of sleepwear which she wore during Tsubasa Cat Arc.  Hanekawa Tsubasa is [Araragi](https://anilist.co/character/22036/Koyomi-Araragi)'s classmate and the class president. Araragi describes her as \"the class president of all class presidents\". Her catchphrase is \"I don’t know everything, I just know what I know\". Hanekawa currently lives with her stepfather and stepmother.\n\nHanekawa Family's Past:  ~!Her biological mother was 17 years old when she got pregnant, the biological father is unknown because she apparently had many lovers. Before she gave birth to Tsubasa, she married another man who was a \"workaholic\". Right after giving birth, Tsubasa's biological mother commited suicide. The workaholic stepfather, unable to raise a child, remarried again to a woman who is Tsubasa's current mother. The workaholic father soon died from overwork and the current mother married another man who is now Tsubasa's current father. !~  Hanekawa Story's overview in Nekomonogatari/Bakemonogatari:  \n\n~!Prior to the beginning of Bakemonogatari, Hanekawa was possessed by the mischievous spirit of a dead cat during Golden Week due to stress over her family. The matter was eventually resolved with the help of Shinobu at the cost of some of Hanekawa's memories, but the problem emerged again right before the school festival because of different stress. Araragi was told by Hanekawa's bakeneko form that she has feelings for him.  In 'Tsubasa Tiger' (Nekomonogatari: Shiro), on her way to school, she met a tiger spirit which spoke to her. Soon buildings important to Hanekawa began to mysteriously burn down and 'Black Hanekawa' (her bakeneko form) began to take over her body every time she slept. The inevitable showdown was afoot and led to some surprising events.  'Tsubasa Tiger' is written from the perspective of Hanekawa rather than Araragi.!~",

As a rule she imposed on herself, she's not allowed to step on the ground. Between the three kouhai during university she was the only one who graduated. She fights by using her fists and is powerful enough to punch through multiple floors at once.",

      "description": "Ougi appears to be a girl with short black hair, black pupils, and pale white skin. She is a junior of [Koyomi Araragi](https://anilist.co/character/22036/Koyomi-Araragi) at Naoetsu Private High School. Ougi often talks to Koyomi about oddities, and helping him remember what he knows. Her catchphrase is, \"I don't know anything, Araragi-senpai. It's you who knows.\"\n\nOugi is mysterious and can come off as spooky/creepy. She also speaks in a condescending tone towards Koyomi and [Hanekawa](https://anilist.co/character/22055/Tsubasa-Hanekawa). Furthermore, Ougi is capable of pulling off many things, despite what she says about what she knows.\n\n~!As of Hanamonogatari and afterwards, chronologically, Ougi refers to himself as a boy. Others will question Ougi's identity when they first meet him as they knew him as a girl before, but they all shrug it off and seem to doubt themselves as to whether he was a girl before. An example being when [Suruga](https://anilist.co/character/22054/Suruga-Kanbaru) asks about it and was told that he has always been a boy since he was born. [Nadeko](https://anilist.co/character/22050/Nadeko-Sengoku) and Koyomi have also have a similar experience. Suruga herself refers to him as 'Ougi-kun', 'he', 'this guy', and 'the boy'. As of Musubi, Ougi seems to be a girl once again, now remaining in the classroom seen in Ougi Formula.!~ ~!The reasons for this seems to be due to Ougi connecting to Suruga after Koyomi graduates, therefore becoming her other side. Thus, Ougi becomes a boy and seems to pretend its the first time he meets everyone afterwards. After Suruga herself graduates, it's likely that Ougi no longer has anyone to connect to and becomes a girl that guides others in the odd classroom.!~",
