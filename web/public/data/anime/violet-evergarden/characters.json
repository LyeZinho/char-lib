      "description": "__Height:__ 161 cm\n\nViolet is described as a very beautiful young woman, being almost doll-like in appearance, with light-blue eyes, a fair complexion, and a slender frame. She is noted for her womanly semblance. She has waist-length golden hair with locks that frame her face. She either has her hair untied, in a low ponytail, or, after becoming a Doll, pulled up into two braided buns with two red ribbons. Due to losing her arms in the war, Violet received maneuverable prosthetic arms made of adamant silver. After the end of the war and on normal occasions, Violet is often seen wearing a white blouse, a green skirt and a pair of heeled brown boots.\n\n~!Growing up as an orphaned child soldier in the army who was treated as a mere tool, Violet was not educated like a regular human being and did not understand human feelings well. She was raised and grew up as a person who had feelings, but couldn't perceive or express them. For this reason, she could be mistaken as emotionless, or apathetic. Even before she was found and taken into the army, she couldn't speak or understand speech, only understanding orders to kill. She did not possess any sense of right or wrong from the start; she didn't understand what could be considered righteous or erroneous. She merely chased after the adults who gave her orders. She followed the idea of \"kill or be killed,\" thus she could kill countless people without feeling guilt or remorse. She did anything that was asked of her and always followed orders, which was a trait from her life as a soldier. Even after the war ended and she was discharged from the military, Violet had a habit of using words back from her life as a soldier; saluting, disliking being defenseless, and doing tasks without taking any breaks. She also continued to think of herself as a \"tool\" and believed that it would be appropriate to discard her if she can no longer be used as a weapon.!~ \n\nViolet is also aloof, expressionless and is said to have the attitude and the presence of a doll. Her expressions are mostly deadpan, so it is hard to tell her mood changes. This is why she sometimes has trouble expressing her own feelings and comes off as expressionless, which makes it difficult to get through her, but she will give a smile from time to time. Through her work as a Doll where she helps people write heartfelt letters, she slowly learns about human emotions, leading her to become more skilled at writing letters and conveying her clients' feelings, as well as becoming understanding of others. She is proven to be a good listener and someone who always thinks about other people's happiness.",
