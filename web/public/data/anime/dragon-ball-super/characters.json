      "description": "__Race:__ ~!Saiyan!~\n__Height:__ 175 cm (5'9\")\n__Birth Year:__ 737 Age  \n__Hobby:__ Fighting a Strong Opponent\n\nSon Gokuu is a boy we meet in a forest far from any civilization. He lives in this forest alone as his grandpa passed away, he only has this special orb-like object called a Dragon Ball to remember him by, which he will sometimes talk to as if it is his Grandpa Gohan. As the series continues, Gokuu meets Bulma, a brilliant teenage girl, and they go on a journey to collect these 7 magical dragon balls which actually have wish granting powers once all of them are collected. During this journey they meet and befriend Yamcha, Oolong, and Pu'ar, whose characters mirror those found in Wu Cheng'en's _Journey to the West_. Gokuu also encounters one his closest friends, Kuririn, and others during his time training. Participating in several World Martials Arts Tournaments, ~!Gokuu also battles foes-turned-allies such as Tien Shinhan and Chiaotzu, as well as the offspring of Demon King Piccolo named Piccolo Junior.!~\n\n~!\n_Dragon Ball Z_ takes place 5 years after the defeat of King Piccolo and Gokuu's last world tournament. We come to find out that Son Gokuu was originally named Kakarot, and is born a member of a race of extraterrestrials called the Saiyans. Shortly following his birth, Gokuu was sent from his home, planet Vegeta, to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life but due to that injury to his head that caused him severe amnesia, Gokuu forgot his purpose, and instead started focusing on becoming stronger for a little more than the pleasure of it. He now has a son named Son Gohan (named after Grandpa Gohan) who is some what of a cry baby but has hidden potential. Throughout the series, Gokuu faces terribly strong opponents like other powerful Saiyans, Intergalactic Rulers, Androids, and Extraterrestrial Beings that give him fights like no other. Along with new enemies, Gokuu also gains new friends that help him in these situations.  \n\nIn  _Dragon Ball GT_, which was not based on Toriyama's manga, Gokuu is turned into a child by a wish on the dragon balls by Pilaf. The series revolves around him traveling around space to find the Black Star Dragon Balls with the help of his granddaughter, Pan, and Trunks. The series ends with Gokuu leaving for good with Shenron and returning one hundred years later to witness the match between Gokuu Jr. and Vegeta Jr.  \n\nIn  _Dragon Ball Online_ (which takes place 216 years after Dragon Ball Z, and unlike Dragon Ball GT, Toriyama had a lot of creative control over the story), a new villain by the name of Miira appears with the goal to obtain Gokuu's DNA.  In  _Cross Epoch_, the  _Dragon Ball_ and  _One Piece_ crossover one-shot, Gokuu is seen accompanying Luffy to attend a party hosted by Shenron from whom key characters from both series had received an invitation.!~\n\n(Source: Dragon Ball Super Exciting Character Guide)",

Vegeta is haughty, arrogant, and filled with hatred and bitterness as a result of the destruction of his home planet and his race's abusive treatment at the hands of Freeza. His royal status seems to have caused him to develop an inflated sense of superiority and he holds himself above most people he encounters.

      "description": "Pu'ar is a soft-spoken shapechanging blue creature and the constant companion of Yamcha. The name is revealed to be a pun on Pu-erh tea. Pu'ar is neither a cat or a mouse, albeit the series creator Akira Toriyama stated that he had drawn the character to look a little bit like a cat. Traveling alongside Yamcha, the two worked as a team robbing anyone traveling through the desert area in which they lived. Pu'ar has an innate ability of levitation or flight, and is nearly always seen simply 'standing' in thin air at about human head height.  Pu'ar has the unique ability to shapeshift into any form, even inanimate objects, and can hold that form for as long as desired; his strength is not increased by the change, however, and as such he is unable to turn into something that can be used up like fuel or food. Pu'ar graduated from the same shapeshifting academy as Oolong, although unlike Oolong, Pu'ar had completed all of the academy training and does not have Oolong's difficulties with maintaining a transformed state. Pu'ar shows up quite a bit in the beginning, but becomes less of a presence as the series continues. As the driving theme of the series is mostly about fighting, Pu'ar can do little more than react to the horrors of the latest supervillains in the story.  There is some debate regarding the character's gender. Despite being portrayed by several female voice actors, the character has been referred to with both male and female pronouns during the anime. Though the issue of gender is never directly addressed, Toriyama has referred to Pu'ar as \"he\" while answering a fan question in the \"Ask Me Anything\" section in the back of the manga. Some fans believe that since shape-shifters can assume many different forms, gender is a moot point.",

Bulma is a direct parody of the character Xuanzang from the Chinese novel Journey to the West. Even though Bulma's character parodies a monk, her Japanese name \"Buruma\" is the brand of a popular gym short worn by girls in Japan. Her re-adapted name Bulma is a direct take on the word \"bloomers\", which was a popular brand of women's underwear in the early 20th century.  Bulma is the second character to be introduced in the Dragon Ball series. In the early part of the story, she is the inventor of the Dragon Radar and is searching for the legendary Dragon Balls. Bulma was hoping to use the Dragon Balls to wish for the perfect boyfriend. While searching for a nearby Dragon Ball, she runs into Son Goku. It is at this time that she finds out Goku inherited one of the balls (the four-star ball) she is searching for from his Grandpa Gohan. Because of Goku's love for the ball and his belief that his Grandpa's spirit lives in the ball, Goku is not willing to give it up. Bulma then asks him to loan it for her in exchange of taking him in her travels. At that point, they team up to find the remainder of the balls and the adventure begins. In the later action-oriented episodes of the series, there is little room for a genius but Bulma continues to play a role as a secondary character, helping Goku and his friends with her gadgets, and having a rather rocky relationship with Yamcha.",

Boo's creator, a wizard named Bibbidi, had used Boo to wage war on the Kaioshin. Boo managed to assimilate two of the four Kaioshin, the second being the one who altered his nature to become innocent. After Bibbidi sealed Boo away, Bibbidi was killed by the fourth Kaioshin, and Boo was transported to Earth where he layed dormant for five million years until he was revived by Bibbidi's son Babbidi during the events of Dragon Ball.\n\nBoo has numerous counterparts in the series. When he first emerges from his shell, he is tall and round, and his personality is naive and innocent. Boo's anger later manifests itself in the form of another Boo (\"The Boo of Pure Wrath\").

He was somewhat demonic and frightening when his castle became engulfed in flames on Frypan Mountain.  He wreaked havoc through the village at the foot of the mountain, threatening anyone he presumed would steal his treasure, until Kamesen'nin showed him the error of his ways. He is Chichi's father and thus Son Goku's father-in-law. Gyuumaouis very strong and trained alongside Grandpa Son Gohan under Muten-Rôshi's tutelage.   As the series progresses, Gyuumaou's role lessens in the story and eventually fades into being a background character, used only for slight comic relief. Gyuumaouis also the grandfather of Gohan and Goten. In anime filler, he has a few large roles though from time to time, mainly accompanying his family and the others.  \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

By the time of the Majin Buu Saga, he is a minor character, but still makes small appearances. He only briefly appears in Dragon Ball GT, now having a mustache, in episode 40.  In the alternate Future Trunks time line, Yajirobe, interestingly enough, didn't go into hiding with Master Roshi and the others but instead fought against the Artificial Humans. Although this is not seen in the Trunks TV Special, a brief scene of his death is seen in the Cell Saga of the anime.  He is voiced in the original Japanese version by Mayumi Tanaka, who also voices Kuririn (this was more than likely done because the original manga has Goku saying that Yajirobe's voice sounds like Kuririn's).

      "description": "Marron is the daughter of Kuririn and #18. She was born before the Majin Buu Saga in Dragon Ball Z. As a little girl, she resembles her father. She has his eyes and nose, or lack there of. However, she does indeed have a nose, though small, and as she grows older, Marron begins to look more like her mother. Unlike the rest of the other Z Fighters&#039; children, Marron is the only one who was never trained by her mother or father which means that she either has never shown any special abilities or martial arts skills of her own, or simply doesn&#039;t have any wish to give up on her normal life.",

      "description": "Mrs. Briefs is Bulma's mother and the wife of Dr. Briefs. She is always interested in flirting with Goku and Vegeta. In the anime, she comments that she would like to go on a date with Vegeta and Goku. When Vegeta was offered a place to stay by Bulma - not long after Vegeta had tried to kill the Z Fighters - he was immediately welcomed in and taken aback by Mrs. Briefs; the shock of someone being so pleasant to him almost overwhelmed him.  Not much is known about her, but in the anime she's characterized as the archetypal blonde airhead who loves shopping and eating expensive cakes. Probably the most special feature of this woman is the fact that, as far as physical appearances go, she looks at least as young as her daughter, and unlike Bulma, she doesn't appear to age at all throughout Dragon Ball Z.  Not much is known about her, but in the anime she's perpetually happy, and is characterized as the archetypal blonde airhead who loves shopping and eating expensive cakes. Her first name is unknown.  *Wikipedia",

      "description": "Oolong is a shapeshifting humanoid pig, standing about three feet tall with pale pink skin, who tends to dress in trousers, button-down shirts, and suspenders. He was expelled from shapeshifting training for stealing the teacher's underwear and lacks the ability to change his form for more than five minutes at a time without a break. With his shapeshifting, Oolong can look like anything at all. Oolong's initial appearance was as a villain who terrorized a village and kidnapped their young women. Son Goku defeated Oolong and the girls were returned to their village. Bulma decided that he might be useful on her Dragonball quest and persuaded him to join their expedition. Eventually he becomes good friends with Goku and the others, and helps them to find more Dragonballs. He plays a large role in the beginning of Dragon Ball, but by the end of Dragon Ball Z, he just shows up from time to time. His poor shapeshifting skills (and innate cowardice) made him a very weak character that didn't have much to do once the tone was shifted to more serious action. In the anime and several movies, he appears quite often as comic relief. He is loosely based on the character Zhu Bajie from the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West.",
