His most prominent feature is his set of \"dead fish-eyes.\" He firmly believes that \"youth\" is simply an illusion created by hypocrites, for hypocrites, born from the ashes of past failures. In this state of apparent corruption, he is coerced into joining the Service Club by his futures advisor in the hopes that exposing him to the world will change his personality, and ultimately make him a \"better person.\" He is called \"Hikki\" affectionately by [Yui](https://anilist.co/character/67069).\n\n(Source: Vistrans)",

      "description": "Rumi is a lonely primary school student who is openly despised by her peers. Hayato at first tried to resolve the situation through talking to her in front of her classmates, which instead attracted more hateful attention to her. After much discussion, Hachiman and company decided that the only way out is to destroy the trust between her peers, through having Hayato and Kakeru acting as bullies threatening Rumi's group-mates during treasure hunt and exposing their selfish nature to each other, thus preventing further organized acts of teasing on Rumi. However, in exchange, she would hardly have any friends after this.  (Source:Wikipedia)",

She volunteered to be event organizer for the cultural festival in order to promote her worth without the actual ability to do such job, and thus requested help from the service club.   ~!As such, Yukino took up the role of assistant event organizer and claimed the spotlight in making the cultural festival a successful one, which in turn made Minami depressed about her own uselessness and refused to host the closing ceremony. However, as Hachiman's fierce scolding has successfully turned himself into the scapegoat and shifted the blame away from Minami, she attended the closing ceremony and ended the cultural festival on a high note.!~\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
