When born, a powerful [nine-tailed demon fox](https://anilist.co/character/7407) attacked his village. With a wave of its tail, the demon fox could raise tsunamis and shatter mountains. In a valiant attempt to save the village from destruction, the Fourth Hokage and leader of the Hidden Leaf Village sealed the demon fox within Naruto's newborn body. This was his final act, for the battle with the fox cost him his life.  Despite the Fourth Hokage's dying wish that Naruto is viewed as a hero for serving as the container for the demon (a  _Jinchuuriki_), the adult villagers of Konoha harbored a fierce hatred for him, with many believing that Naruto and the demons were one and the same. Cast aside as an inhuman monster, Naruto was outcast and ostracised by the villagers for reasons he could not understand. The children his age could only ever follow their parents' example; and they too came to harbor a fierce hatred for Naruto.  Naruto eventually came to accept that he would live and die alone, and his external response was to perform harmless pranks on the village. Coy, raffish, and full of life, Naruto soon came to display a somewhat unexpected determination to succeed and be accepted by others. Upon being assigned to \"Team Seven\" as a Genin-ranked ninja, his true potential soon became outwardly apparent.  Vowing to become Hokage one day and using his will to never give in, Naruto saves the village from invading forces and earns his acceptance. Eventually, Naruto learns to harness the power of the Demon Fox sealed inside him to perform acts of strength far beyond what any other human is capable of.  In all, Naruto is an admirable character whose sheer determination to succeed despite the odds, earns him respect and devotion from his fellow villagers.",

He also doesn't hesitate to do things he doesn't enjoy or that others might find embarrassing if it means his own self-improvement, as seen with his belief that one cannot dislike food regardless of its ingredients or taste. In addition, Guy values his youth to a great degree and dislikes the idea that he may not be as young as he once was. To help remedy this problem he spends large amounts of time with his younger teammates, hoping to acquire some of their youthful properties.

Of the ten, Anko was the only one to survive, establishing the one-in-ten chance of surviving the Cursed Seal. Orochimaru supposedly rejected Anko as a subordinate, believing she did not have the lust for power or vengeance needed to fuel the Cursed Seal. Orochimaru lost interest in her, though he believed there was some value in letting her live. In the anime, after learning of her past, she was glad to discover that she wasn&#039;t tossed away like trash as she first had thought by Orochimaru, but chose to leave Orochimaru herself.    Anko is easygoing, tomboyish, playful, stubborn, and sometimes hyperactive, making her very similar to Naruto Uzumaki in many ways.

Hinata was trained by her father, Hiashi Hyuga, to become the clan's heiress, though in time he came to deem her a lost cause. Believing her to be of lesser skill than her younger sister, Hanabi Hyuga, her father left Hinata in Kurenai Yuhi's care once she was assigned to Team 8, claiming he didn't care what happened to her. Throughout her early time in Team 8, Hinata's lack of self-confidence and unwillingness to fight hamper her abilities. Although she would train to improve her skills, she would immediately give up when faced with competition and failed every mission she was assigned as a result.  In an attempt to change herself, Hinata enters the Chunin Exams, where she is pit against her cousin, Neji Hyuga, in the exam's preliminary matches. Neji is quick to ridicule Hinata for her personality traits and attempts to convince her that she is a failure who will never be able to change herself, bringing her to tears. Naruto Uzumaki's encouragement, however, empowers her to fight her cousin despite repeatedly being struck down. Although she is defeated, Naruto's words have a lasting effect on Hinata and she becomes more confident in her abilities, and even sticks up for herself by telling Neji that he is the one who is attempting to fight against what cannot be changed. After recovering from her wounds, Hinata continues training to prove herself to her father and Naruto. Her efforts are successful in both regards, as she is eventually able to acquire a better relationship with her father, who encourages her to continue working on improving herself. Naruto has also come to hold her in a higher standing, and he tells her that while he had considered her timid and weird before, he now views her as a likable person.  Hinata has a long-standing crush on Naruto, which has been present since their time in the Academy. Her feelings for him are rooted in his determination, confidence, and strength, all of which Hinata lacks. With her affection for Naruto, Hinata is constantly willing to break away from her normal personality traits in order to help him. She also becomes more assertive for Naruto, and also doesn't hesitate to defend him, even to himself. Her feelings for Naruto are one of the driving forces in her self-improvement, as she tries to gain strength in an attempt to both impress him and become like him. When they meet again in Part II, Hinata is unable to bring herself to greet Naruto and passes out when he comes to greet her, her feelings for him having apparently been amplified during his absence. Despite this, she gradually becomes more comfortable around Naruto, going from being unable to look him in the eye to being able to talk to him, and is able to work with him without difficulty when they are on missions together.  As a member of the Hyuga clan, Hinata possesses the Byakugan, which gives her an almost 360 field of vision. During the Chunin Exams, she displays the ability to focus the Byakugan's sight, increasing the distance that her eyes can see. She also specializes in the Gentle Fist fighting style, which allows her to damage her opponent's chakra circulatory system and inner organs directly with even a slight tap. In her quest to get stronger, Hinata creates a new ability during the anime's Bikochu arc called Protection of the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms (守護八卦六十四掌, Shugohakke Rokujūyon Shō?), a combination of the Hyuga clan's most powerful techniques. With it Hinata emits streams of chakra from her palms to create extremely sharp blades that she can use to hit any target in her field of vision. Due to the speed at which these blades move, the amount of control she has over them, as well as her ability to manipulate their size, Hinata can use this technique to attack and defend simultaneously.",

Neji and Lee have somewhat of a rivalry, much like that of Guy and Kakashi Hatake. Lee is determined to prove that a \"failure\" such as himself can defeat a \"genius\" such as Neji. Neji, however, doesn't seem to be interested in this goal of Lee's, and Lee doesn't seem to have made an effort to prove the point to Neji. Despite this apparent clashing of ideals between the two, Neji seems to get along fairly well with Tenten, with the latter often helping Neji with his training. Neji and Tenten also tend to share opinions on Lee and Guy's overreactive behaviors, often wondering how they can train the way they do.  As a member of the Hyuga clan, Neji possesses the Byakugan, allowing him to see the chakra flow of others and block the flow upon contact with his Gentle Fist style. As a member of the clan's branch house, Neji can never hope to be taught how to use the clan's most secret techniques by the clan's elders. Despite this, Neji has learned many of the clan's strongest techniques independently, even creating a few unique skills of his own. Because of this, Neji is known as a genius ninja and graduated from the Academy as the #1 rookie.  Because his father, Hizashi Hyuga, was a member of a branch house of the Hyuga clan, Neji was born into the branch house. As a result, he was branded with the Hyuga branch family seal at a young age so that the members of the main house could keep him in check. Hizashi, believing Neji to be denied his potential as a branch house member, openly resented the main house, causing Neji to acquire the same feelings due to his father's influence. In time, Neji's hatred for the main house would increase exponentially as result of Hizashi being sacrificed to save the life of Hiashi Hyuga, Hizashi's twin brother. Neji believed that his father was forced to die for his twin brother. Because of this, Neji came to feel that fate was something decided at birth and that no matter what one does, people cannot escape their destiny. This idea would go on to shape Neji's life, creating a deep hatred for the main house and all of its members.   After the Chunnin Exams when Neji fights Naruto his both his great skill and potential are recognized by the clan leader, his uncle Hiashi Hyuuga, and is sought out by him to train with the main branch of the family to further enhance Neji's skills. This helps ease some of the tensions between the two branches of the Hyuuga clan.",

To help Sasori cope with the death of his parents, Chiyo taught him the art of puppet making. He began making puppets at the age of five, and was even able to create puppets that resembled his parents in an attempt to mend the terrible loneliness he felt. Sasori later lost interest in these puppets because they were lifeless beings unable to give him the natural parental love that he desired. Sasori was a born natural at the art, even devising masterful ways of eliminating a puppet master's weakness. Sasori was the creator of numerous masterfully crafted puppets, a number of which were used by Kankuro.

Before joining the Akatsuki, Deidara was a terrorist bomber for hire. His work caught the eye of Pain, who sent other Akatsuki members to recruit him. Though he refused at first, Deidara was forced to join the organization after being defeated by Itachi Uchiha. Deidara maintained a deep loathing for Itachi from that point onward and became determined to defeat him, even training one of his eyes to overcome Itachi's signature ability: genjutsu. Deidara was partnered with Sasori upon joining the organization, who earned Deidara's admiration through his artistic ability and insight. Deidara was partnered with Tobi after Sasori's death, whom he treated as a disciple. Despite Tobi's habit of accidentally angering Deidara, Deidara took great care to keep Tobi out of harm's way and even spent his final moments apologizing to him.  In battle, Deidara uses special mouths on the palm of each hand to create Exploding Clay, chakra-infused clay that explodes on command. He commonly uses the command \"Katsu\" to trigger it. The blast strength of his creations is determined by how much chakra he adds to them. His clay can take on any size or form, ranging from microscopic in size to copies of himself as tall as a skyscraper. Deidara refers to his creations as \"art,\" believing the most beautiful thing about them to be their detonation. His admiration for his art is to such a degree that he believes it can't be defeated, leading to a feeling of overconfidence in battle. Depending on the complexity or potency of one of his works, Deidara applies it a designation that ranges anywhere between \"C1\" to \"C4\", the former being the most basic and the latter being his strongest and most complex attack. For his final act, Deidara also has a mouth on his chest that, once provided with clay, turns him into a living bomb that destroys everything within a 10 kilometer radius.",

Suigetsu once trained to be one of the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist, and as such has a number of traits consistent with other known members. In addition to having shark-like teeth, Suigetsu enjoys killing; Kisame Hoshigaki, one of the Seven Swordsmen, claims Suigetsu is a prodigy at the art of murder, as he has a habit of chopping off his victim's limbs before beheading them. He is also very confident in his abilities, since he has threatened Sasuke Uchiha on more than one occasion. Not afraid to speak his mind and always doing as he pleases, Suigetsu clashed with Sasuke at first, but eventually came to accept Sasuke's position and even put himself in harm's way to protect him.   After joining Hebi, Sasuke takes Suigetsu to retrieve Zabuza Momochi's giant Kubikiri Hōchō from his graveside. Suigetsu can wield the weapon with relative ease, despite its enormous size and weight. In his allegiance with Sasuke, Suigetsu hopes to acquire the sword of Kisame as well, which Karin assumes to mean that he wants to collect all of the swords of the Seven Swordsmen.  Suigetsu is able to reduce himself to liquid form and return to bodily form at will. This ability also allows him to change his body shape, giving him the ability to increase the size of his limbs, proportionally increasing his strength, if necessary. It also makes striking him somewhat difficult; since he is made of liquid, any sufficiently powerful strike will go right through his watery form. Suigetsu is the first ninja seen carrying water bottles on his outfit. Given his somewhat frequent desire to consume water, it is suggested that Suigetsu requires regular hydration to sustain his watery form.",

This is partly due to him seeking paths of least resistance, as he often chooses to do things he would otherwise not do if people nag him enough. In his free time he typically takes naps, watches clouds, and plays strategy games such as Shogi and Go. When put into a situation where he potentially needs to put effort into something, he attempts to try to find a way to avoid it such as forfeiting a battle or by pretending to be preoccupied with something else. In the instances where he can not avoid these situations, Shikamaru tends to remark \"how troublesome.\"\n\nDespite his lazy tendencies, Shikamaru is extremely intelligent. His teacher, Asuma, found Shikamaru to have an IQ of over 200, and learned that Shikamaru's poor grades were a result of him finding lifting a pencil to be too much work for him. Nevertheless, Shikamaru works very well with his teammates, as their fathers were teamed together in their youth.\n\nOne of Shikamaru's more distinctive characteristics is that he finds all women to be bossy and \"a pain.\" Contrary to this opinion, he has expressed a notably mature interest in marriage and raising a family with a son and daughter. Ironically, Shikamaru seems to constantly find himself surrounded by the very same strong-willed and bossy women he dislikes. In addition to his own mother, and being surrounded by bossy females, he usually ends up fighting against such women. Shikamaru has had a number of his appearances coincide with those of Temari. When they make their Part II debut together, Naruto Uzumaki asks if they are on a date, though both Shikamaru and Temari state that this is not the case.\n\nWhen the need arises, Shikamaru is quick to abandon his lazy nature and act appropriately to complete a mission or save his teammates. Using his Shadow Imitation Technique, the signature technique of his clan, he can capture the shadow of an opponent to either keep them immobilized or force them to mimic his movements.",

Despite his open display for his love of food, Chouji is very sensitive about his size and becomes highly agitated when somebody calls him \"fat\". Once called \"fat\", Chouji's resolve to fight is elevated to new levels and he becomes much more hostile to his opponents than he would otherwise. Just as they use food against him, Chouji's teammates use this personality trait against him as well. Should Chouji be reluctant to fight, one of them need only comment on his size to spur him into combat form.  As an Akimichi, Chouji's style of combat focuses on increasing his size.

Doing so cost him his life, and before dying he asked that the villagers not see Naruto as the monster within him, instead wanting him to be viewed as a hero, a request ignored by the villagers. \"Namikaze\" translates literally as \"Wave wind\". \"Minato\" translates as \"Harbor\" or \"Port\".    ~!Minato shares a number of traits with Naruto, namely in appearance and attitude. Such comparisons are common throughout the first part of the series, and in the second as well. The second part of the series reveals that Naruto is his son, hence the comparisons, born to Kushina Uzumaki. In his youth Minato, along with two other unknown Genin, was a student of Jiraiya. Prior to becoming Hokage, he was also the sensei of Kakashi Hatake, Obito Uchiha, and Rin. !~ Minato is said to be the greatest ninja Konoha had ever produced, with natural talent that had not been seen in many years. He created several distinctive techniques, including the Hiraishin no Jutsu, which essentially allowed him to teleport to any location with the use of a special seal. By attaching the seal to a kunai or an enemy, Minato could teleport to the location of the seal unnoticed, allowing him to wipe out nearby opponents almost instantly. This ability led to his title as \"Konoha's Yellow Flash\", and it caused him to be seen as so dangerous that a flee-on-sight order was given in regards to him during the Third Ninja War. He also created the Rasengan, a technique that does not rely on hand seals but instead uses a concentration of spinning chakra in one's palm that causes immense damage to its victim on contact. Later in the series it is revealed that technique is actually incomplete. Minato had planned to add his own nature manipulation training to the Rasengan, making it even more powerful, but could not manage to prior to his death.   ~!Later during the war he is resurrected by Orochimaru with Edo Tensei alongside all the deceased Hokage on Sasuke's demand.!~",

He now wears the same ring as Sasori, having recovered it after Sasori's death, and took his place as Deidara's partner. Unlike the majority of ninja thus far, Tobi has not been shown wearing a visible forehead protector, so his place of origin is unknown. He wears an orange mask with single eye-hole covered in a swirl pattern concentrated towards the right eye. This odd mask that covers his entire face save for his right eye. Furthermore, Tobi has several bolts or pins present on the arms of his uniform, now obscured by his Akatsuki cloak.  Tobi's area of expertise remains unclear, as he has never been shown fighting. He and Deidara have defeated the three-tailed beast, but Tobi is never shown doing anything but running from it. After the battle, which goes largely unwitnessed, Tobi claims to have knocked it out with a single attack. Deidara disagrees with the assessment, claiming that it was his \"artistic contribution\" (exploding clay) that allowed them to win. During his fight with Sasuke, Tobi shows the ability to recover from what are presumably debilitating or fatal blows. After being slashed across the midsection by Sasuke's sword, Tobi collapses, only to stand up again a few seconds later and complain about the speed of the attack. Aside from this, Tobi has yet to demonstrate any techniques.  Tobi has a very formal and correct manner of speech. While his physical appearance remains a mystery, Zetsu has implied that he is relatively young when one side of him referred to Tobi as a \"good boy.\" He respects Deidara, referring to him as Deidara-senpai. Tobi's personality is rather odd in comparison with other Akatsuki members. While most of the members are dedicated and serious, though somewhat argumentative or even hostile towards each other when not fighting, Tobi is more carefree and goofy, much like Naruto. His personality does not please Deidara, who believes that all Akatsuki members should be serious and calm. Tobi unintentionally irritates Deidara frequently, which usually results in Deidara attacking Tobi in a comedic fashion.    ~!However, after Deidara and Itachi's death he is later seen and heard with a more serious and calm tone in his voice. The carefree side of Tobi is not seen again.!~   ~!Later Tobi claims to be Uchiha Madara, the founder of the Uchiha clan and first mangekyo sharingan user. He later changes his mask after obtaining the rinnegan to allow him to use both eyes simultaneously. !~   ~!During the Fourth Shinobi World War, when he meets Naruto and Bee he says to be no one and that they could calling him Tobi, Madara or No One.!~   ~! In chapter 599 it is revealed that Tobi is actually Obito Uchiha who was teammates with Kakashi Hatake and Rin under the Fourth Hokage. Obito got his right side crushed when he saved Kakashi by pushing him out of the way of a rock slide. Unable to escape with his teammates, Obito had Rin implant his remaining Sharingan eye in Kakashi's damaged eye socket as a gift. After that it was believed that Obito died.!~",

When his extensions are open and his head is visible, it is revealed that Zetsu has two different colored halves of his body, the left side completely white and the right side black. To go with this, Zetsu seems to have a split personality, as in the Japanese version of the manga the black half of his face speaks only in Katakana while the white side uses Kanji and Kana, and in the English episodes the black side has a different voice actor than the white side. The two halves also converse with each other, and occasionally differ in opinion (the black half is more serious and intelligent while the white half is carefree and easygoing). They also seem to communicate with their thoughts. To further his venus fly trap theme, Zetsu is a cannibal.   Zetsu is seemingly very trustworthy, being entrusted with knowledge of Pain and Tobi's identities. He has apparently been working with the latter for some time, Tobi first appearing as his \"subordinate\" and Zetsu later commenting that Tobi's plans have been in the works for a long time.   Zetsu's main role within the Akatsuki is to function as a spy, often acting as a hunter-nin for Akatsuki. He has been shown able to move his body and take part in the tailed beasts sealing ritual imultaneously which, in addition to being unique to him, allows him to act as a lookout while the sealing takes place. When an agent to Akatsuki, or possibly even a member, dies, Zetsu is sent to devour their bodies so as to not have their secrets revealed. Zetsu is also the one sent to retrieve the rings of dead Akatsuki members. Due to the role he plays, Zetsu is the only member of Akatsuki to act without a partner on a regular basis.

Kakuzu is a greedy individual, prioritizing things in terms of how much they are worth and finding money to be the only thing that he can depend on. Kakuzu's favorite source of income is collecting bounties while carrying out other missions, even putting up with Hidan's religion since it allows him to collect bounties faster. His history as a bounty hunter seems to be extensive, as he is on friendly terms with a bounty collector and even seems to have memorized the information and worth of some of the more dangerous bounties. This view of money has caused Kakuzu to refer to himself as the \"Treasurer of Akatsuki\", though it is unknown if this is an actual position. Kakuzu also has his own personal banker and accountant. Despite his attachment to money, he places the orders of the Akatsuki leader before any opportunity to make a profit. Kakuzu greatly dislikes the fact that he needs a teammate as a member of Akatsuki, due in part to his habit of killing anyone near him (partners included) when enraged. Having killed all of his previous partners as a result of this, Kakuzu was partnered with Hidan. Neither Kakuzu nor Hidan are fond of their partnership, Kakuzu having little patience for Hidan's time-consuming battle style and rituals and Hidan, in turn, detesting how Kakuzu fights solely for money. Still, because Hidan is immortal, Kakuzu can attack him without worrying about finding a new partner.",

He is the principal figure in the tailed beast sealing ceremony.   ~!The first and leading \"Pain\" appearing in the series is actually Yahiko, one of six animated corpses collectively known as \"The Six Paths of Pain\" that are all controlled by one person's will[ch. 378, 419]: Nagato of Amegakure. At a young age, Nagato was secretly visited by Madara Uchiha who implanted his Rinnegan (lit. \"Saṃsāra Eye\") into the child's body, giving him the ability to use abilities based on the six Buddhist paths of reincarnation. Orphaned, Nagato met fellow orphans Konan and Yahiko before they are all trained by Jiraiya. Nagato desired peace for the world, aiding Yahiko to create the Akatsuki to achieve that shared dream. However, a trap laid by Amegakure's dictator Hanzo led to Yahiko's death, causing Nagato to take over as the new leader of the organization. Though the encounter crippled Nagato, the experience of having his best friend die caused Nagato to come to the realization that peace could only be attained by teaching the world the pain caused by war.  To that end he adopted the alias \"Pain\" to conquer Amegakure and invented the Six Path of Pain to overcome his handicap and kill Hanzo, becoming a \"god\" in the eyes of Amegakure's citizens. Having made cosmetically alterations to the other Paths by dying their hair to match Yahiko's, the Paths are all outfitted with a number of body piercings that serve as a means for Nagato to control them and to give them a \"more dangerous\" appearance in relation to their name's installation. Through Nagato's Rinnegan, they can also share visual information and coordinate attacks.  Jiraiya would later confront Nagato regarding his role as \"Pain\", the leader of Akatsuki. The two would fight with Nagato dismissing his former mentor's ideals as well as killing him. During Pain's attack on Konoha, the six Paths are defeated by Naruto. Talking with Naruto, Nagato renews his faith in his late master and in the possibility of peace. Nagato sacrifices his life in order to revive the people he killed in Konoha.[ch. 449] Nagato is later resurrected by Kabuto and sent alongside Itachi to battle Naruto and Killer Bee, but is sent back to the afterlife.!~",

He was the sole survivor of the Kaguya clan, who could manipulate their bodies' skeletal frame. The Kaguya clan was wiped out when they attacked Kirigakure, seemingly for no reason other than the desire to kill. Having underestimated their opponent's defenses, they were slaughtered to the last man, with only Kimimaro surviving.  NOTE: Though some fans believe that his full name was Kimimaro Kaguya, the second databook only said his name as Kimimaro.  Kimimaro was referred to by Orochimaru as the most powerful member of the clan, having \"abilities that even that war-loving clan feared\". Because of this, he was locked away in a cage for most of his life, only released occasionally when needed to fight other clans.\n\nLike many of Orochimaru's closest followers, Kimimaro was branded with a cursed seal, which gives him greater power at the expense of his free will. When in his level 2 form, his appearance is similar to that of a dinosaur, with dark gray skin, six large bone spines on the back of his chest, and a long bone spiked tail. He also possesses a great deal of control over his cursed seal, as he is able to control its spread throughout his body without fully activating it. Kimimaro was apparently friends with Jugo at one point, and his control over his cursed seal impressed the latter. Karin claims that Kimimaro was the only one who could stop Jugo without getting hurt.   ~! Kimimaro succumbed to his disease and died in the middle of his fight with Gaara during the Sasuke Retrieval Arc, moments before he was about to deliver the finishing blow to Gaara and Lee.!~",

Kiba is often short-tempered and impulsive (in stark contrast to his teammates Shino and Hinata), and can be prone to making mistakes when he becomes agitated in battle. The fact that he enjoys combat, as well as a habit of showing a joyful smile when facing a particularly strong opponent, indicates that he is willing to risk his life for a mission, and is rather bloodthirsty. He deeply cares for Akamaru, and is willing to do whatever is necessary to protect him. And, despite his rather gruff attitude, many of Kiba's actions reveal that he is very close to his older sister, Hana Inuzuka, and remains fiercely loyal to the Inuzuka clan. Kiba's personality and jutsu style are further enhanced by his wild appearance. While clearly human, he has several physical traits more akin to animals.

Despite their apparent differences, Gaara and Kankuro become very close over the timeskip as Gaara begins to confide in Kankuro and shares his dreams of wanting to risk his life to protect Sunagakure.

When Gaara is captured by Akatsuki, Kankuro rushes to his brother's aid in an attempt to save him and even after being nearly killed as a result he does not falter in his resolve to find Gaara.  Kankuro has shown to be a rather violent and brutal opponent, often leaving his opponents in extreme pain after battle. He is a talented puppeteer, and with each of his appearances in the major arcs is seen with a new puppet in his arsenal.

Karasu, the first of Kankuro's puppets to make an appearance, has been heavily modified by Kankuro. Because of this it is highly offensive, having numerous concealed weapons and being able to detach any of its limbs for separate attacks. Kuroari, the second of Kankuro's puppets to make an appearance, is used to capture opponents for assassination purposes. Once an opponent is captured within it each of Kuroari's arms convert to saw-blades and slice through the confined opponent. Sanshouo, the third of Kankuro's puppets to make an appearance, is not seen in action in the manga. In the anime, Sanshouo is shown to have a hollow body that Kankuro can take cover in to defend against attacks. These puppets seem to be designed to work together to some degree, as Kankuro frequently uses them in tandem to increase their effectiveness. Karasu, for example, can blanket an area in smoke while Kuroari fires weapons at the blinded opponent.",

      "description": "The Nine-Tailed Demon Fox, whose real name was recently revealed to be Kurama, is the most powerful of the tailed beasts, also considered the \"King of the Tailed Beasts\". Its power is such that it is regarded as an age-old natural disaster, as a single swipe of one of its nine tails is enough to raise tsunamis and flatten mountains. One of its special abilities is that it has access to close to unlimited sources of chakra.   The demon fox's attacks were seemingly random, the only apparent reason for its appearances being its attraction to places of human malice. It attacked Konohagakure twelve years before the start of the series. None of the ninja of the village were able to defeat it until the Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze, arrived to deal with it. Minato sacrificed his life to seal the fox into the body of his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki, with the Dead Demon Consuming Seal. Rather than completely seal off the fox's great power, however, Minato only sealed away a portion of it, giving Naruto access to the rest for unknown reasons. Prior to performing the seal Minato gave a key to Jiraiya to either strengthen or weaken the seal should the need arise. The seal naturally becomes weaker as the years pass, and in the event that it is broken the demon fox will be released. However, the bond between Naruto and Kyuubi, and the bond between Jinchuuriki (host) and tailed beast in general, is of a such character that if the seal is broken, Naruto will die immediately thereafter. And if Naruto dies, and the seal is not broken, Kyuubi will die with him. Therefore Kyuubi uses some of its chakra to enhance Naruto's healing abilities and will sometimes \"take over\" (lend Naruto its chakra without him asking for it) in order to keep him alive.   ~! Naruto and Kurama later become friendly, much like Killer Bee and his tailed beast, Gyuuki. This allows Naruto to finally take full control of all of Kurama's abilities, including being able to use Tailed Beast Mode. !~",

However the war still waged on, and unsure of the title of Hokage he would not only appoint his brother as his successor as the Second Hokage (Nidaime Hokage), but in a common decision with his brother they also decided that one of their students Sarutobi should become the Third Hokage (Sandaime Hokage), which in turn seemed like a wise decision as both brothers would eventually die during the wars. \n\nHe was most famous for his unique Wood Release techniques, a kekkei genkai that is a mixture of earth and water-natured chakra that creates this new element. By converting chakra into the source of life, he was able to create trees, causing them to grow to great sizes and manipulate them to diverse shapes and battle uses at will. In an instant, he could shape the entire battlefield for his own uses.",

      "description": "__Background:__ Not much is known about his childhood, only that one day he went berserk and wrecked the Temple of Fire, a place otherwise believed to be an indestructible fortress. Afterward, he was loathed by some of the monks of the temple, and soon began receiving the same treatment as a Jinchūriki. He wanted to become part of the Twelve Guardian Ninja. He hates himself because of his powers and gets angry when people stare at him. When they first meet he hates Naruto but then they become friends. Sora does not like getting help from people, especially ninja. He did not even want Team Yamato to come. \n\n__Part II Fire Temple Filler Arc:__ This arc begins due to a misunderstanding, Naruto Uzumaki fights one of the monks-in-training from the Fire Temple, Sora, who also uses wind chakra based techniques. After the confusion, the monks and Team Kakashi travel to the Fire Temple. The temple monks explain that the tombs hold the loyal bodyguards of Fire Country's feudal lord. Naruto observes Sora sparring with other monks and becomes offended upon realizing he is holding back. Naruto challenges Sora, but just as the matter is about to get serious, another monk stops him. Naruto realizes Sora is despised by the other monks as he was himself and wishes to befriend him. Naruto visits Sora again and observes him practicing his wind jutsu in earnest, hoping to get strong enough to avenge his father. They later return to the temple to receive news that another tomb has been robbed. They are later ambushed by a group of enemy shinobi and Sora, unwilling to look for Naruto, goes off on his own. Sora then hits upon the enemy leader, Furido, and it is revealed that he is the group's target. Sora then starts to question Furido, but he does not answer. Instead, he just sits down and roasts some potatoes. Sora gets angry and his chakra starts to get more powerful. Furido taunts Sora until Sora unleashes his true powers, before informing him that he is planning to use the four corpses to save the Land of Fire. After an explosion, Sora wakes up only to find out that Furido had vanished, only leaving him a clue that he knows his father and that Sora resembles him. Sora then is assigned to go to Konohagakure with Team Yamato to replace Sai because of Sai's injuries. \n\nNaruto tries to show Sora around Konoha but Sora goes his own way. Sora's insults precipitate a brawl with Kiba Inuzuka and Choji Akimichi, and Naruto and Rock Lee soon join in. Later Asuma Sarutobi tells Sora he knew Sora's father, who is revealed as one of the Guardians involved in the coup attempt. He also shows Sora his chakra blade attack and then volunteers to help train Sora and Naruto. Asuma supervises Naruto and Sora's wind chakra training and notices that Sora, like Naruto, has very powerful chakra. Later, Asuma gives Sora a claw made from the same materials as his chakra blades. It is revealed that Asuma killed Sora's father Kazuma, who had planned to kill the Hokage. Furido then approaches Sora, telling him that Asuma is responsible for his father's death and passing him two &quot;king&quot; pieces from a Shogi set for Asuma. Shocked by this discovery he goes back to training distressed. Then Naruto approaches a furious Sora in the training grounds, who easily throws a chakra-powered kunai through a tree and destroys the stone behind it. \n\nLater on, Sora tries to look for Asuma and follows him to Danzo's interrogation. There he found out that Homura Mitokado and Koharu Utatane dislike Sora and don't welcome him in the village and plan to kill him. Before Tsunade can make her decision on what to do with Sora, he is caught by ANBU members hiding in the ceiling. Enraged, he yells at Tsunade asking her why would she kill him. Are his powers really that hated? He then goes on by saying that they are just like the fire temple monks. He looks at Yamato asking him, &quot;are these what you call comrades?&quot; He then changes his view towards Asuma and confronts him, accusing him of killing his father, which Asuma confirms. Sora attacks Asuma, his arm once again assuming a demonic form. While he blows Asuma outside, he is unable to maintain it for long and falters. He is attacked by an unknown individual (presumed to be a Root shinobi), but Naruto shields him from the shuriken, being injured in the process. Sora then approaches Furido, who says that he must kill Asuma and Tsunade to avenge his father and consolidate the &quot;two kings&quot; (the Feudal Lord and the Hokage) into a single leader by eliminating the Hokage. \n\nLater that night, Naruto catches Sora going after Tsunade. Sora retreats as Shizune and a few other ninjas arrive, and Naruto pursues him. At that moment, a mysterious lightning storm strikes, cutting off power to the entire village. Meanwhile, Naruto chases Sora for attempting to kill Tsunade. Asuma, commanded by Tsunade to follow Sora and Naruto, finally catches up to them. Asuma realizes that the four invaders plan to annihilate the entire village using the lightning powers of the corpses that they stole. The revelation shocks Sora. As Asuma leaves to help hold off the attackers, he instructs Naruto to continue to pursue Sora. Later on, Furido tells Sora that when The Nine-Tailed Fox rampaged around Konoha, The Fourth Hokage sealed the beast within Naruto Uzumaki and the nine tails chakra that had slipped out when it rampaged was sealed it into Sora by Kazuma and the fire temple. He, Furido, then proceeds to use the Five Elements Unseal to release all of the demon fox's power. Sora grows a demon fox cloak similar to Naruto's, except that he has three spikes on each side of his face.     Like Naruto, he grows tails which increase in number the longer he keeps himself in the demon fox cloak state. If nine tails grow, he will turn into a real demon fox. Later, as Asuma and Naruto arrive, it is revealed that Furido is actually Kazuma, Sora's father. A confrontation between Naruto and Sora later occurs, concluding with Sora losing control of his demon fox chakra. According to Captain Yamato, Sora's body did not have the proper capacity nor natural chakra reserves to contain the demon fox's chakra unlike Naruto, thus concluding this filler arc with Sora losing all of the demon fox's influence including the demon fox's chakra as well as Sora's pseudo-jinjuriki arm. \n\n__Abilities:__ Sora is a wind-natured chakra user like Naruto. He is able to manipulate wind into chakra infused wind blades of energy capable of cutting through most material including rock. He wields a tri-bladed death claw that he learns to infuse with chakra after learning the jutsu from Asuma. Asuma gives him a new blade after his old one is destroyed in a fight with Naruto. Sora also uses Taijutsu known only to the monks of the Fire Temple. Sora's father Kazuma spliced his cellular make-up with the excess chakra of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox to create a Pseudo-Jinchūriki. Sora is capable, though unwillingly it seems, to transform into a miniature demon fox much like Naruto. In this form, he has all the power and resistance to injury and attack of an unsealed demon fox.",

He along with Nauma, Tōu, and Seito were known as the greatest lightning-chakra masters of their time. Like Asuma, his battle style revolved around combining superb taijutsu skill with his elemental affinity through a unique weapon. He used a three-parted metal staff to fight with, that is also able to conduct his lightning based attacks. Kitane could send lightning through the ground to attack by striking his staff into the ground. When separating his staff into three pieces he can use his jutsu Lightning Release: Thunder Binding to form a barrier around a target. When in one of the four cardinal directions, he along with Nauma, Tōu, and Seito could use a jutsu called Limelight to destroy everything within that area to ash.",

Although in the filler arcs Gamatatsu showed that he does care about Naruto's life as he was ready to rescue him before Gamakichi talked him out of it. It should be noted that Gamatatsu appears to be the most subservient and loyal of the main frog summons as he was willing to serve Naruto before Gamakichi brought up the snack remark. While being naive and childishly stupid, he does sometimes make use of his natural curiosity to help Naruto solve puzzles (like the mystery of the Ghost Warrior in the filler arcs). Gamatatatsu's obsession for snacks is so great that he waited a year since his first summon for the snack he was promised, even though he didn't get it. He is always hungry and asking his summoner for snacks, and often gets mixed up in unusual predicaments which he counts on his \"big brother Gamakichi\" to get him out of. In the english dub, his voice is jocularly high and he is usually used for comic relief when he is summoned. He also openly refers to Gamabunta as \"daddy\", which the older toad either chooses to ignore or simply doesn't mind.",

When he is first seen, he is portrayed as a bit of an alcoholic, and at times uses some of Shikamaru&#039;s catchphrases (&quot;What a drag&quot; in English, &quot;How troublesome&quot; in Japanese). Like his son, he thinks that women should be tender and sweet, but as his son says, his wife has him whipped. Also like his son, he is a very lazy person, but he is also quite caring, and is ready to jump into action when needed. Unlike his son, his resolve is much stronger, as even during the most depressing or dangerous of situations, he has shown to maintain great determination and understanding as shown from how he has repeatedly helped his son regain his sense of worth. He also seems to be very smart as he has defeated Shikamaru in shogi. \n\nLike his son, and the rest of his clan, Shikaku uses a special secret clan type of Jutsu, that utilizes the manipulation of shadows in various combatable ways. Although he has only been seen in combat once, as the head of his respective clan, it is highly presumed that he has mastery of his clan&#039;s techniques. Shikaku&#039;s intelligence and skill as a ninja, has also earned him the position of Jounin Commander - the highest-ranking position to which a normal Shinobi can be promoted.",

She uses the unique Crystal Release brand of jutsu.    As a child, Guren came from an unknown small village where she was shunned by others because she had unique powers. Later, Orochimaru appeared and destroyed the entire village single-handedly. He was intrigued by Guren&#039;s powers and offered for her to come with him. Guren chose to follow him because she envied his power. Quickly, she became one of Orochimaru&#039;s most powerful and loyal subordinates. Eventually, she was offered to become one of Orochimaru&#039;s future vessels. Guren would also later know that the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox, the mightiest of the Tailed Beasts, had ultimately came into the possesion of the Hidden Leaf Village following the events where the Fourth Hokage sealed it into his recently-born son, but due to the extreme secrecy held within that Village regarding this matter, like everybody else outside of Konoha, Guren was left oblivious about the identity of the powerful demon&#039;s container, Naruto Uzumaki, whom she would later encounter, instead coming to the conclusion that the Nine-Tails capture was for the sake of augmenting the Hidden Leafs military power. When Sasuke Uchiha defected from Konohagakure and Kimimaro was no longer a suitable vessel for Orochimaru, Guren became the next best choice in Orochimaru&#039;s eyes. Unfortunately by the time she arrived, Orochimaru couldn&#039;t wait any longer and instead chose Gen&#039;yumaru. Feeling no longer of use to Orochimaru, Guren went into isolation. It is later revealed that she in fact killed Yūkimaru&#039;s mother.     Guren has shown to be very mysterious, apparently preferring to keep to herself despite having a strong loyalty to Orochimaru. During her introduction, she quickly showed herself to be a remorseless and sadistic person. When told by Kabuto that several prisoners would be fighting to the death, she became ecstatic to hear there would be a slaughter. Guren is also shown to be vain by the fact that when she used her Jade Crystal Mirror technique, she looked at her self and said &quot;Lovely, as always.&quot; She has also shown to be very proud. When Naruto offered to carry her she was embarrassed because it was shameful.  She is devotedly loyal to Orochimaru, to an almost obsessive state. This devotion was so powerful that she fell into despair when she learned she would not become Orochimaru&#039;s next vessel, isolating herself from the shame. It has also been shown she has a terrible relationship with Kabuto, as the two argue often, trading scathing remarks.[1] Later, she meets Yūkimaru, and at first, she finds him peculiar and somewhat irritating. When Yūkimaru became ill, she cared for him, watching over him for an entire night, until she fell asleep from exhaustion. When she woke up, she found that she was alone--and went searching for Yūkimaru, who she found a little ways outside under a camellia tree. She then develops a sort of friendship with him as she crystallizes a beautiful flower and gently tells him that the flower will never wither as long as she is alive. He tells her that he lost his mother in similar circumstances while going out to find him a red camellia. Guren later comes across a red camellia patch, where she seems prompted to bring him one.    Since coming in contact with Yūkimaru, Guren seems to be having conflicting emotions. While part of her still wants to be accepted by Orochimaru as his next vessel, another part of her seems unable to let go of the bond she has made with Yūkimaru to the point of protecting from even Orochimaru&#039;s right-hand man, Kabuto. The emotions seemed to have become more confusing for her in her first one-on-one confrontation with Naruto, who stated bluntly how horrible and selfish a man Orochimaru really is.    After realizing the truth behind her past and how it connects her to Yūkimaru, Guren feels even more compelled to protect him, out of guilt and repentance for her past sins, as well as love--wishing to become an almost &#039;surrogate mother&#039; to the boy, to replace the mother she killed. She even goes so far as to turn her protection to Naruto, as they faced off against the small Three-Tails clones within the tailed beast&#039;s stomach, telling him she would protect him to the death if he would watch after Yūkimaru. This is a great change from her previous interactions with Naruto, where she was stand-offish and combative. Subsequently, Guren has also begun to have doubts over remaining loyal to Orochimaru, due to her grief over the horrible things she was made to do in his name, and the damage and pain he has caused Yūkimaru, and herself.     Three-Tails Arrival arc    To aid him in final preparations for his plan, Orochimaru sends Kabuto to fetch Guren (much to Kabuto&#039;s disapproval). Guren attacks him when he approaches her domain, but he is able to avoid her attacks. When asked why she attacked him, Guren states that she just wanted to make sure Kabuto was worthy of being Orochimaru&#039;s right-hand man. Upon returning to Orochimaru&#039;s hideout, she has hundreds of Orochimaru&#039;s prisoners fight to the death and forms a team with the survivors: Rinji, Gozu, Kigiri, Kihō and Nurari.    Guren, disapproving of Sasuke&#039;s status as Orochimaru&#039;s next vessel, is later offered a chance to replace Sasuke if she can prove herself. She and Yūkimaru are sent to a certain area. While there, Yūkimaru gets sick, forcing Guren to care for him. When he recovers, she is surprised to learn he too knows what it is like to have no one at such a young age and seems to have grown some feelings for him. She then crystallizes one of his flowers, knowing how much he likes them, so it won&#039;t wither as long as she is alive. Later when finally meeting back up Team Guren, she leaves Yūkimaru at the hideout while she goes out to handle the Team Kurenai.    While her men fight Team Kurenai and Kakashi, Guren prepares for their arrival. Once done she has her men fall back, drawing the Konoha ninja into a trap and allowing Guren to encase Hinata in crystal. She uses Hinata as a hostage to prevent her men from being followed. Before anything can be done, Team Yamato arrives and breaks through her traps and defenses and subsequently frees Hinata. Annoyed at her enemies escaping, she decides goes back to their hideout to plan their next move, but Kabuto comes in and explains another plan.    Kabuto, Guren, and her men go out to the lake so that they can awaken the Three-Tailed Beast. When it appears she tries to restrain it, but proves no match for its strength, the whole time holding Yūkimaru in a protective hug. When she uses the last of her chakra to save Yūkimaru and the others, she later awakens to find herself in the care of Yūkimaru.    Guren then finds herself having a dream about the her childhood with Orochimaru and dreams about a woman. After she awakes, she finds that Yūkimaru is sick again, speculating that it was because of Kabuto&#039;s overdose of pills. While taking care of Yūkimaru, she detects Naruto coming and intercepts him. After a short scuffle, Yūkimaru appears to stop the fight. It is here that Guren hears another view of Orochimaru from Naruto, making her question the path she has taken.    After escaping with Yūkimaru, she and her team begins preparing for the final confrontation with the Leaf Village and hoping to face Naruto again to settle things with him. Upon facing the Leaf Ninja again, her Crystal Release again proves to be very powerful. Unfortunately for her, Shino&#039;s insects finally build up a strong enough resistance to make her powers useless. Although nearly perishing against her opponents, Gozu sacrifices himself to allow her to escape. Before escaping, however, Naruto made it clear to Guren that he&#039;s determined to take Yūkimaru away from her no matter what. At first confused at why the younger shinobi could possibly be interested in Yūkimaru, Guren quickly rallies up and came to the conclusion that the Hidden Leaf shinobi became aware of Yūkimaru&#039;s powers, and are striving to obtain the boy in order to reign control over the Three-Tails    While returning to the hideout, she hears Yūkimaru play with a grasswhistle and perform a melody she remembers. She then realizes to her horror that it was her who killed Yūkimaru&#039;s mother. Upon the revelation, Guren begged Kabuto to not put Yūkimaru through anymore pain, instead offering her own services to stop the Leaf Ninja from sealing away the Three-Tails. With the help of Rinji, Guren was able to stop the seal. Unfortunately, the Three-Tails then turned its attention to Guren. Luckily, Yūkimaru was able to save her by using his powers to stop the Three-Tails.  Guren recalls her second encounter with Yūkimaru&#039;s mother  After seeing how desperate Yūkimaru was to protect her, Guren&#039;s guilt towards the boy became greater than ever, knowing that the boy was clinging to the person who had killed his mother. Deciding to atone for her crimes to Yūkimaru, Guren chose to do everything in her power to protect him. Despite being battle-worn and low on chakra, Guren attacked the Three-Tails head-on. Fortunately, Naruto soon appeared the and the two grudgingly worked together to battle the beast. Ultimately, the Three-Tails managed to capture and swallow the two whole.    Inside the beast, Guren is surprised to see Naruto there as well. She tries to attack him, but the injury she sustained earlier caused her to pass out; when she came about, she became even more surprised that Naruto without hesistation treated her wounds. The two quickly begin arguing about where Yūkimaru belongs. Guren states bluntly that she refused to let Yūkimaru succumb to any harm. When Naruto accuses Guren of using Yūkimaru&#039;s abilities for Orochimaru&#039;s benefit, Guren retaliates that the Leaf Village being barely any different, only interested in obtaining more demons to create more Jinchūriki, now that they&#039;ve learned of Yūkimaru&#039;s ability to tame the Three-Tails. Naruto quickly replied that his Village had no interest in the Tailed Beast itself, Guren calls him a liar, apparently aware that the Hidden Village already owns the host for the Nine-Tailed Fox. Naruto stops her train of thought by revealing that he is that very Jinchūriki, but one whom, for most of his life, his own Village did not treat as a proper being (much less their ultimate weapon), but rather, a living memory of the horrific catastrophe that the Tailed Beast which now resides within himself once wreaked upon the Hidden Leaf. Upon learning that Naruto refuses to use his demon powers in fear of hurting his loved ones, she begins to see that Naruto genuinely is concerned for Yūkimaru&#039;s well-being. Together, the two begin looking for a way out of the Three-Tails.    As they found themselves being cornered by the mini-Three-Tails, Guren felt compelled to admit to Naruto her hand in causing Yūkimaru&#039;s loneliness. After revealing the truth, she decides that Naruto is right, that Yūkimaru&#039;s place should not be with Orochimaru nor her, but with Naruto. Her sincerity towards this statement is proven by her desire to make sure Naruto gets out alive. To her surprise however, Naruto says she has changed and can make up for her mistakes. Together, they manage to escape the Three-Tails. Unfortunately upon escaping, they discover that Yūkimaru is again being used to control the Three-Tails.    Along the way, Guren has doubts about revealing the truth to Yūkimaru, but Naruto convinces her to prove her sincerity of protecting Yūkimaru even if refuses to forgive her. Being inspired by this, she and Naruto arrive in time to save Yūkimaru from being forced to take a strange drug from Rinji, who turns out to be Kabuto in disguise. Kabuto decides to reveal the truth to Yūkimaru, to which Guren makes no attempt to stop. To her shock and joy, Yūkimaru decides to forgive her. The two then admit to how much they mean to each other. Guren leaves with Yūkimaru under Naruto&#039;s orders, and Kabuto summoned the deceased Rinji with his reincarnation jutsu, and Guren battles him in an attempt to protect Yūkimaru. Taking no chances, she used her signature Crimson Fruit jutsu to keep him safe. Guren tried to trap Rinji in her Crystal Jutsu, but he used his bats&#039; supersonic abilities to shatter the crystal, saving himself and subsequently stopping Guren from using her Crystal Style. Devoted to protect Yūkimaru with her life, she went behind Rinji and kept his hands apart, to now prevent HIM from using jutsu and controlling the bats. Though unable to perform any hand signs (with her hands busy holding back Rinji&#039;s arms), Guren still managed to use the Crystal Style and crystallize herself and Rinji. The two fell into the water below. Gozu later saves her. Yūkimaru later joined up with them, and the three of them left together.       Abilities    Guren possesses a unique ninja art; the Crystal Release. It is not clear that it is a kekkei genkai or a power unique to her, also Guren made it clear to Kakashi that he cannot copy her techniques with the Sharingan. By using this power, Guren can summon and manipulate crystal in a number of ways such as creating crushing walls or unique shuriken. It is stated by Kabuto and by Kakashi that she can crystallize moisture in the air, therefore giving her an infinite source of weapons. The density of this power appears to be very high as even the Wood Release was unable to penetrate it. This ability is presumed very powerful as Orochimaru at one point desired it for himself.  Guren uses her crystal style    In times of desperation, Guren is also able to convert a small portion of her life energy to access extra chakra reserves to allow her to continue fighting at full strength for a short period of time.    Guren&#039;s taijutsu skills are also rather high as she was able to fight on even grounds with an expert like Kakashi, dodge multiple Rasengan attacks from Naruto, and fight Lee and Tenten simultaneously. She is talented at noticing weaknesses in her opponent and using diversions, shown in how she kept the rest of Team 8 busy fighting her clones while she takes Hinata as hostage. After that she is seen to tell Naruto what she feels about Yūkimaru. In addition, Guren also has good senses and is a keen observer. She was able to tell when Kakashi and Yamato were near and she was able to conclude that the Sanbi was trying to protect it&#039;s eye just by watching the way it defended an attack.",

He is a test subject of Orochimaru, because he has the ability to control the Three-Tailed Giant Turtle. Yukimaru is a quiet boy, probably due to his past, he constantly ask questions like \"Is it going to be fun?\". His main goal is to find home and is told by Naruto that home is a place where people think about you, which lightens his spirit. Yukimaru always telling that he has no home to go to. Later on Kabuto sets off together with Yukimaru for a journey. They eventually arrive at a dark swamp. There, Kabuto conducts an experiment where he forcibly releases the full power of Yukimaru's chakra. This results made the Three-Tailed demon to partial emerge before submerging again.  Later, he is sent out again with Guren to complete a mission. During which, he succumbs to sickness, forcing Guren to care for him. As a result, he seems to have grown attached to Guren and possibly vice-versa. This is further emphasized from how Yukimaru reacted when Guren tells Yukimaru she has to head out in a manner similar to how Yukimaru's mother did before presumeably dying. He then gives her his necklaces with a special charm on it.  Later, Yukimaru again bumps into Naruto, who offers for the orphan to join him in Konoha, to which Yukimaru politely declines as he feels his place is with Guren. Soon after, Kabuto returns to conduct another experiment with Yukimaru. He has Yukimaru take several medical pills. Ultimately, this finally causes the Three-Tailed Beast to emerge.  He is able to controlled three-tailed beast, for the first time he has to drink the pills from Kabuto to release Three-Tails Chakra but later he manage to release it without pills. Yukimaru also has illusion technique, when he meet Naruto, white camellias appear on everywhere. Then he and white camelias (tsubaki) disappear on the same time.",

      "description": "__Affiliation:__ Amegakure  \n__Team:__ Ame Orphans  \n__Manga Debut:__ Chapter #372  \n__Anime Debut:__ Naruto Shippūden Episode #128  \n\nYahiko (弥彦) was a shinobi from Amegakure and once a student of Jiraiya along with Nagato and Konan.   \n\n__Background:__ Yahiko was orphaned during the Second Shinobi World War, and, thus, he started fending for himself, stealing food from others. He later encountered Konan, also an orphan, and the two began to work together to survive. After this, Konan brought another orphan, Nagato, and his dog, Chibi, into the group. At first, Yahiko was upset that she was bringing more people, but he later accepted Nagato and Chibi into his gang. Angered by how unfair the world was to them, Yahiko declared he would become a god to end the fighting.  The three eventually encountered Jiraiya, who looked after them and taught them basic ninjutsu. At one point, Nagato saved Yahiko after an Iwagakure chūnin attacked them. Afterwards, Yahiko vowed to become strong enough to protect Konan, Nagato, and eventually all of Amegakure.  Some time after Jiraiya's departure from Amegakure, the three gained a reputation as a talented shinobi team. Still desiring to create a world of peace, Yahiko and his friends went on to become fully fledged Ame ninja, and gathered many supporters who shared their hope to save their village and the world.   ~!Yahiko eventually united them together with the name of Akatsuki, an idea Madara Uchiha claims to have given him. Akatsuki spread their beliefs to stop war without violence, and news of their actions would reach Jiraiya from time to time. Their group became so well renowned that even the then leader of Amegakure, Hanzō, started to view Yahiko and his supporters as a threat to his power. Working with Danzō during the Third Shinobi World War, they captured Konan and forced Nagato to choose to let Hanzō kill Konan or for Nagato to kill Yahiko himself. Without hesitation, Yahiko drove himself into a kunai that Nagato was holding. With his final breath, he told Nagato to continue their mission of finding peace.!~   ~!After his death, Nagato using his Rinnegan and chakra receivers, incorporated Yahiko's body into his Six Paths of Pain technique. As the Deva Path, Yahiko's body had acted as Pain's main body, it being the one he most commonly used and spoke through. The Deva Path was held in higher regard during combat, some of the other bodies being sacrificed to ensure its survival. It has a wide variety of ninjutsu, the most prominent being able to manipulate gravity.!~\n\n__Personality:__ Yahiko's personality was similar to Naruto's. His dream was to be a leader of his village, and he never gave up no matter what. When he was alive, Yahiko had a strong \"eye for an eye\" philosophy. He hated the way Amegakure was looked at by the rest of the world, and hated what it had become. He was defensive of the village, saying that it was his dream to stop the endless rain, which he compared to tears, and protect the nation's citizens. Yahiko wanted to become the ruler of the world so there wouldn't be any more wars.  Among the three Ame Orphans, Yahiko seemed to act as the leader of the group. It was Yahiko who first approached the Sannin to ask for food, and was the first to ask Jiraiya to teach them ninjutsu. He also seemed to act as an older brother for Nagato and Konan, reminding Nagato to not cry and to act more manly (although Yahiko was the one who cried when Jiraiya left them). He also wished to become stronger so as to protect Nagato and Konan. He had faith in Nagato, when he got older.   \n\n__Abilities:__ Yahiko had the ability to use water-based jutsu, although the only example of this shown in the series was Water Release: Violent Water Wave, in which he was able to shoot a jet of water from his mouth.  \n\n(Source: Narutopedia)",

Despite his decades of suspicious deeds, Danzō only ever acted in what he believed were the village's best interests.

Kurotsuchi describes him as a &quot;stubborn old man&quot;. His pride has him give very little respect for those younger than him. \n\nHe is a powerful and capable Tsuchikage.

      "description": "Darui is a jōnin-level shinobi from Kumogakure. He is also the Commander of the First Division of the Allied Shinobi Forces.   \n\n__Personality__ \n\nDarui is portrayed as being easy-going and mellow; when compared to the Fourth Raikage's over-the-top exit through a window, he tells C that he'll just use the door. Whilst having a laid-back demeanour, Darui isn't lazy, leaping to the Raikage's defence when the bodyguards of the other Kage overreact to the Raikage's actions. He also has a habit of referring to things or events as being \"dull\" a play on his name. Darui is also very apologetic, even apologizing for other people's actions, a trait he'd never noticed himself; this attribute led him to say \"sorry\" just as much as \"dull\". He is also very loyal to the Raikage who considers Darui his \"second right hand\". He adresses the Raikage with \"boss\" rather than \"Raikage-sama\".   \n\n__Abilities__ \n\nDarui is a highly skilled and capable shinobi. He learned how to create Black Lightning under the tutelage of the Third Raikage, making his lightning techniques even more powerful. His chakra reserves are great enough to not die of chakra exhaustion after using three of the Treasured Tools of the Sage of the Six Paths and still have enough chakra left to continue fighting. His abilities have earned him the praise and recognition of the Fourth Raikage himself, who appointed Darui as his personal bodyguard and considers him his right-hand man. Kenjutsu Darui wields a long and fairly broad sword that is peculiar than others swords as it folds in two to be sheathed and unfolds when in use. He has shown exceptional skills in kenjutsu, as he was able to clash with Suigetsu Hōzuki's Kubikiribōchō and easily overwhelm and pin him to a wall with his lightning imbued sword. He was also skilled enough to literally disarm Ginkaku and Kinkaku during their battle, and knock Ginkaku into Kinkaku's Kōkinjō while quickly seizing the Shichiseiken and Benihisago.  Nature Transformation Darui is proficient with water and lightning release techniques, and is able to use two separate techniques of the natures simultaneously. He uses Lightning Release: Wave of Inspiration, together with water release jutsus to let electricity flow through the water and make the jutsus deadlier. He has shown exceptional skills with Lightning Release techniques individually, able to use Black Lightning, a special form of lightning passed down to him by the Third Raikage. With the power of the \"Black Lightning\", he could use techniques like the Lightning Release: Black Panther to immobilize and/or kill several enemies. According to one of his comrades, he is the only person to have inherited the Third Raikage's Black Lightning. Darui is also proficient with the use of chakra flow with ballistic weapon. His skill with chakra flow is such that he was able to cut through a metal blade with a lightning-enhanced shuriken. He also possesses the kekkei genkai known as Storm Release, which combines both lightning and water chakra to create beams of light that can be freely guided like missiles and cause powerful explosions.",

In contrast to his easy-going partner, C is portrayed as serious and putting Kumo's well being above all else. This is briefly shown when he told Darui there was no time for rest upon their return from the Kage Summit. He also seems to have a slight dislike of Konoha ninja, calling Naruto's group \"Konoha Dogs\".  C is a sensor type shinobi, allowing him to sense the chakra of others even from extended distances. He is also a medic-nin and seems to be very knowledgeable on foreign shinobi techniques, as he is shown recognizing Sasuke's Mangekyō Sharingan along with Amaterasu. C was able to deduce how Sasuke's Blaze Release worked after only seeing it once. He is also a skilled genjutsu user, as he was shown using Lightning Illusion Flash of Lightning Pillar, followed by a second genjutsu within the first. All of these abilities also imply a mastery of multiple skills requiring very fine chakra control.  Also of note is when he went to defend the Raikage from the bodyguards of the other Kage he took a defence taijutsu stance, implying he is competent in close combat as well",

The dress only covers up to the upper part of her upper arms and the underside of her breasts. Underneath, she wears a mesh shirt that covers more of her upper body than her dress, but stops short of covering her shoulders and still leaving a sizable cleavage. She also wears shorts in the same colour as dress and, underneath those, mesh leggings reaching down over her knees. Around her waist, she wears a belt with a pouch attached to the back on the left.",

Except for the lower half of his face, his features were covered by a mask. Glasses were built into the mask obscuring his eyes as is common for the Aburame clan. He wore a short black jacket with red strands hanging over the shoulders, similar to Sai's and his partner, Fū's. This most likely shows allegiance to Root. He also wore a high collared, all black outfit with a red sash around his waist and what appeared to be an apron over his pants, similar to that of Neji Hyūga's. He also carried several pouches with him and wore a pair of black gloves. When first introduced, Torune's appearance was that of a regular Konoha ANBU, complete with a white cloak and mask.  Danzō stated that he and Fū are two of the most-skilled ninjas in Root. Torune is part of the Aburame clan, and like the other members, he is skilled at using insects in combat. However, his bug techniques are rare even among the Aburame. He controls the many nano-sized, venomous insects that covers his body, allowing him to infect anyone with a mere touch.  Due to this he wears gloves and keeps his skin almost completely covered when not in battle. The insects spread onto the opponent's skin causing severe pain which can potentially lead to death. Torune can call off the insects with a touch of a finger and remove the venom using an antidote. Shikuro Aburame is said to be the only one with an antidote for the insects' venom and the antibodies in his blood to render him immune to the insect's poison, so it is thus assumed that Torune is his son. Like many other Root members, Torune wears a tantō on his back, though he has not yet been seen using it.",

One day Hotaru was under attack by a group of ninja who were actually after Utakata. Utakata saved Hotaru from the ninja, but was wounded in the battle. Hotaru ran for help from her fort, saving Utakata&#039;s life, causing him to become indebted to her. After this, he became a sort of master to Hotaru in order to hide from anyone who is after him. Later she finds him sleeping under a tree and Utakata got angry when Hotaru called him master, saying that the relationship between a master and a student is not something you can count on. Utakata reluctantly begins to teach her the Water Walking Exercise first, believing that she wouldn&#039;t master it. In the morning, she shows that she was able to stand on top of the water by training all night. Next, Utakata taught her Water Release: Violent Water Wave, once again believing that she would not be able to master it without water-natured chakra only to discover she does possess water-natured chakra. She later found Utakata under a tree and showed him the she again mastered the technique much to his suprise.     When a group ninja came looking for the Tsuchigumo clan&#039;s kinjutsu, Tonbee had Hotaru, along with Utakata, take the clan&#039;s forbidden jutsu so that ninja could not retrieve it. While traveling, Utakata got upset at Hotaru for calling him master (師匠, shishō), at which point Naruto arrived, believing Utakata to be attacking Hotaru. Hotaru broke up the fight and Utakata left her, deciding that Team 7 would be capable in protect her. As she watched him float away in a bubble, she tried to convince him not to leave, but was unsuccessful in doing so.    While on the way to the clan&#039;s secret village, Naruto argues with her only for Yamato to devise a plan to convince Hotaru to accept their protection. Using his unique jutsu, Sai drew mountain leeches to fall on Hotaru, who freaks out and becomes afraid, causing her to accept Team 7&#039;s protection. When they reached the village, Team 7 leaves Hotaru with the Tsuchigumo clan and Hotaru thanks Naruto before he leaves. When Naruto left he saw the look on the peoples faces back at the clan&#039;s village, so he decided to return to check things out.     Source: naruto.wikia.com",

Being several thousand years old, he is the oldest and most respected among the population of Mount Myōboku. At his great age, the Great Toad Sage seems to constantly smile and tends to have his eyes closed or squinting. He is portrayed and described as being senile, and sometimes out of touch with his present situation, so he does tend to forget things easily and quite quickly. However, when reminded, he is still able to remember things and can easily tell things very precisely. As a sage, he is also very wise, and is quick to stop Shima and Fukasaku from bickering and encourages harmony. It would seem that unlike most other toads, he actually has respect for Jiraiya, and has urged both Shima and Fukasaku to cooperate with him",

All of the hand seals performed also give the Conch King a signal to use a specified technique. Kandachi has shown a rare ability to cast a genjutsu on his opponent though the Conch King. The magnetic field caused by the tree strengthens this genjutsu, as the magnetism disrupts a person&#039;s chakra flow, similar to a genjutsu. Kandachi can also command the Conch King to propel above water by using Wind Release.     When Jiraiya brought Naruto Uzumaki to the forest for training, they encounter Tanishi who tells them of Kandachi&#039;s takeover. Naruto (disguised as Tanishi) and Jiraiya, pretending to be captured, meet with Kandachi, surprised to see Jiraiya again.

He was buried in the village's graveyard.  Jiraiya mentions that Sukune and his family were very kind to him when he visited the Genjutsu Tree Village the first time, and is sad to hear of his death when he returns with Naruto later. He is known to be respected in the village. The husband of Yone and the father of Tanishi. No noticeable skills- he is shown to be fairly strong from the civilian's standpoint, but his skills are not nearly equal to those of a ninja.",

Kosuke has been a genin for over fifty years, thus the reason others called him the Ten-Thousand-Year Genin. When he was still a child, he made a reckless decision that cost him the lives of his teammates. Feeling ashamed of this, he felt he was not worthy of being promoted beyond the rank of genin. Despite this, he continued to train arduously to improve his skills, something that was insisted upon him by Tobirama Senju. During his time as a ninja, he had served under the Second, Third, and Fourth Hokage and now apparently even the Fifth Hokage. At other points, he fought alongside Jiraiya and Sakumo Hatake.   Kosuke is an elderly man with his once black hair now grayed which he wears in a short ponytail. He wears a mesh armor shirt under a short brown sleeveless kimono as well as gray pants. He is usually seen with a smile on his face. He carries a metal pan that he uses for multiple reasons ranging from cooking in while out on missions to a weapon during battle. He also carries a ladle and a sword sheathed horizontally across his lower back.   Even though his official ranks is that of genin, he is skilled enough to become a Jōnin; a promotion he declined time and time again. He has shown considerable taijutsu skill, able to use only his cooking-ware to defend and maneuver against enemy attacks. He is also a skilled kenjutsu fighter and wields a sword and a hidden blade concealed in his prosthetic left leg, both of which he can use to strike with deadly precision. He also demonstrated the use of a unique technique which incorporated genjutsu along with kenjutsu to confuse and petrify his opponent, making it easier to strike them down.  When he was younger, he was taught many techniques by the Second and Third Hokage. His training under the Second has given him highly proficient skill in high caliber water release techniques, allowing him to use techniques such as the Water Release: Water Dragon Bullet Technique and Water Release: Water Encampment Wall. He also learned the Shuriken Shadow Clone Technique from the Third Hokage.  In addition to combat skills, Kosuke is a highly capable survival expert and cook.   He was placed on a team alongside Hayama Shirakumo, Tekuno Kanden and Naruto Uzumaki to guard the borders of the village after Orochimaru and Sunagakure's invasion of the village. He remarked that Minato had left behind a fine son, showing that he was one of the few people who was aware of Naruto's lineage.",

After a short fight, Sabiru deceived him with a shadow clone and threw him in the river below. He managed to grab a rock, but Sabiru appeared on top of it, saying he had already killed his wife and burned down his house. He then proceeded to extract Kisuke&#039;s soul from his body, sealing it in a tag, which was left attached to the rock.    The tag was eventually found and accidentally removed by Naruto, resulting in Kisuke&#039;s soul appearing before him a short time later as a ghost, with no memories of his past life. After asking around Konoha, he and Naruto discovered Kisuke&#039;s comatose body in Konoha Hospital: the body was later killed by Sabiru, resulting in a second &quot;death&quot; for Kisuke. With Naruto&#039;s help, the now deceased ANBU found out the location of his home, which they found burned down. In this place, by seeing a tulip, Kisuke had his memory back, and revealed what had happened.

Before the era of ninja villages, Madara and his younger brother, Izuna, were considered the most gifted members of the Uchiha clan. Even by his clan's standards, Madara's chakra was especially strong. He grew up constantly competing and training with Izuna and in their efforts to surpass each other, each gained their own Mangekyō Sharingan. With the power of the Mangekyō the two brothers took control of the clan, with Madara as its leader. Under his leadership, the clan conquered all they came across. Because of the never-ending series of battles of the time, Madara eventually began to suffer from overuse of the Mangekyō Sharingan, leaving him blind. In order to regain his sight he took Izuna's eyes for himself, granting him an \"eternal\" Mangekyō Sharingan with which he led the Uchiha clan to prosperity.  Over the years, the Uchiha had constantly fought with the equally powerful Senju clan and as such, Madara had an undying rivalry with Hashirama Senju, the leader of the Senju clan. To bring an end to the constant fighting, Hashirama approached the Uchiha with an offer of peace. Although Madara never wanted peace with the Senju, the rest of the Uchiha wished to end the fighting, and Madara had no choice but to accept. The Senju, the Uchiha, and all the clans they had conquered came together to form the village of Konohagakure.  Some time later, the villagers of Konoha selected Hashirama as the village's first Hokage much to Madara's dismay. Madara feared that Hashirama would oppress the Uchiha, and tried to rally support for challenging his leadership. Rather than help him, the Uchiha turned their backs on him, believing he only desired to rekindle the flames of war.  Soon after being rejected the position of Hokage and being abandoned by his clan, Madara left the village, and sought out Nine-Tails. He later returned in order to challenge Hashirama in battle. They fought at the site that would someday be called the Valley of the End, where Madara was defeated, despite having Nine-Tails at his side. Control of Nine-Tails was ultimately taken from him and Madara was believed to have died.   ~!During the Fourth Shinobi World War, after Nagato is sealed by the recently freed Uchiha Itachi, Kabuto uses his 'trump card' by having Mū use the Impure World Resurrection to summon the 'real' Uchiha Madara (then-proving that Tobi is merely using the his namesake, and that he is in fact not Madara). After being resurrected, Madara also shows his ability to utilize not only his Sharingan and Mangekyou Sharingan abilities, but also those of the Rinnegan and Wood Jutsu.!~",

After Motoi's father was killed during an attempt to subdue the Eight-Tails that had broken free from its previous jinchūriki, Motoi came to hate the Eight-Tails. B was soon chosen to be the beast's next jinchūriki and Motoi, just as many other Kumo villagers did, focused his anger towards B because he was to be the vessel of the beast. He once tried to assassinate B to avenge his father, but was disarmed by B easily. Despite having his face covered, Motoi assumed that B knew it was him, as B ungrudgingly greeted him as they used to with a fist bump. After this, Motoi could never bring himself to face B, and hadn't spoken to him for thirty years, but in time he came to admire B as a village hero.",

      "description": "The Eight-Tails is a tailed beast sealed within Killer B of Kumogakure after his cousin, cousin's uncle and cousin's father failed before him.   Since Killer B is one of the few jinchūriki to gain control over his tailed beast, his relationship with the Eight-Tails is very relaxed. Where the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox constantly threatens its jinchūriki and must be either restrained or confined to be spoken to, B and the Eight-Tails can talk leisurely, with Killer B even sitting on its nose. However, B tends to annoy the Eight-Tails to comical effect; his serious and no-nonsense demeanour often contrasts with B's tendency to goof off whenever he likes, adding fuel to the Tailed Beast's irritation to his vessel. The Eight-Tails is not above bad-mouthing B as a result. The Eight-Tails is also known to scold him in serious occasions as shown when it criticised B for rapping in his fight with Kisame when he should have been completely focused on their opponent. Because of this, the Eight-Tails appears to be much more note worthy than B as far as responsibility is concerned. Before B learned to control it, the Eight-Tails was infamous to be wild, and violent. It also went on many rampages whenever its former jinchūriki would lose control of it.   Despite the Eight-Tails' strong relationship with Killer B, its main goal, like the other beasts, is self preservation. For example, it was more than willing to be released and attack Kisame Hoshigaki despite Sabu and Ponta being close by. The Eight-Tails is also shown to have a good analytical ability, as it told Killer B that if he left Ponta and Sabu and run in the opposite direction Kisame and the water will follow him and they (Sabu and Ponta) would be freed. The Eight-Tails mentioned that it used to be much more aggressive and violent but that Killer B changed it. It also said that it doesn't like the Nine-Tails but insisted that was no reason for B to refuse to help Naruto take control of the beast, hinting a benevolent side. Since then, both the beast and B have taken a liking to Naruto. The Eight-Tails also tends to reprimand B. This is usually shown in a comical manner as when it bumped B in the head when the latter started to mention in a perverted matter how Yugito's chakra receivers where embedded in her left breast.   With regards to its relationship with the other tailed beasts, the Eight-Tails maintaining that they had their own emotions and personalities has expressed dislike of the Nine-Tails' habit of ranking their strength based on their number of tails and has also stated that seeing another beast being forcefully controlled angered the rest of them greatly.",

Ten years prior to the formation of the Allied Shinobi Forces, Suiren was part of Ganryū's team that was tasked with retrieving a scroll along with a team from Iwagakure taken by Kumogakure shinobi. After retrieving the document, Suiren was excited for the prospects of peace that a mission like this would bring. She was however wrong as Iwagakure betrayed them. After Junsai was killed, Suiren sacrificed herself in order to protect Ganryū. This incident which come to be known as the Tragedy of Yosuga Pass marked the begining of hostility between Kirigakure and Iwagakure.  Suiren was a kind and loving person who dearly held onto the ideals of peace. After their mission was seemingly completed she spoke openly of what an alliance like this between Kirigakure and Iwagakure would mean for the shinobi world.  She was a very beautiful kunoichi with brown eyes and long blonde hair with two strands framing her face. She wore a pair of earrings along with the standard attire of the Kirigakure-nin complete with forehead protector and flak jacket, along with the jade-green bangle that was worn by her team.

His camouflage is so good that he has become renowned as the \"Non-Person\" (無人, Mujin), a title which he gained for seemingly having neither form nor chakra, while the technique was active. It is impossible to detect him by normal means and so, Mū considers anyone with the ability to sense his presence worthy of praise.  Mū is one of the few people capable of using a kekkei tōta, an advanced and extremely powerful form of kekkei genkai. In particular, he possesses the Dust Release, which allows him to combine the fire, earth and wind natures to reduce his opponents to nothing more than mere dust, destroying them down to even a molecular level. Compared with fellow dust-user, Ōnoki, his power is implied to be on equal terms, as when the two initiated Dust Release: Detachment of the Primitive World Technique, the disastrous outcome although chaotic, demonstrated no evident victor in regards to strength. This may be due to the fact that Mū's power hadn't waned since his lifetime, a fact later affirmed by Ōnoki.

He has a tendency of saying the word \"hot\" (あつい, atsui) and admits that he has created a substantial amount of \"hot-shot\" catchphrases. Like many other Kumogakure shinobi, Atsui is extremely proficient in kenjutsu, incorporating a long white katana as part of his main fighting style. When this blade is utilised in conjunction with his Fire Release nature transformation techniques, through the application of Chakra Flow, he is capable of incinerating a significant quantity of opponents in a single instant. The anime also showed that he is able to conjure flames with each swing of his sword.",

He was commanded by the Fourth Kazekage to assassinate Gaara, but was given the choice in deciding whether he wanted to proceed or not. Yashamaru willingly accepted the command in order to avenge his older sister's premature death. The assassination attempt, however, ended in a desperate suicide mission and ultimately failed. Before he died, he told Gaara that no one had ever really loved him, not even him. This left Gaara even more of an emotional wreck than he already was. His suicide bombing attempt on Gaara's life caused Gaara to become somewhat psychotic. Yashamaru's last words, to Gaara, were \"This is it. Please die.\"  !~\n\n(Source: NarutoWiki)",

This is achieved by first striking with the axe, before hammering it through the remainder of the obstruction with the hammer, resulting in the axe functioning much like a wedge. The 'swords' construction still allows the weapons to retain their individual capabilities and thanks to Jinin's expertise, both the axe and the hammer can be exploited to their fullest.
