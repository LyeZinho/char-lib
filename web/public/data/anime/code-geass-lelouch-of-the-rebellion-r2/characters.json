A brilliant thinker who is quite talented at chess, he lives with his younger sister, Nunnally, with their maid, Sayoko Shinozaki, at a house situated within the compounds of Ashford Academy, where they are looked after by the Ashford family.  Lelouch is soon swept into the conflict between the Britannia Empire and the pockets of resistance which oppose it when he accidentally boards a truck being used by Japanese resistance operatives. Within the truck is a capsule holding C.C., who sacrifices herself to save him from the military forces trying to recapture her. When it seems as if her sacrifice was pointless, C.C. suddenly touches his hand and offers him the \"Power of the King\", the mythical power of Geass. The Geass manifests itself in him as the power of absolute obedience, which allows him to make people obey his orders without question.   With his new power, Lelouch begins his rebellion against the Empire, forming the Order of the Black Knights and takes up the identity of Zero to lead them, becoming a revolutionary and gaining popular support amongst the people.   \n\n~!Lelouch is the son of the Emperor of Britannia, Charles zi Britannia, and the late Imperial Consort Marianne vi Britannia, making Lelouch the eleventh prince of the Britannian Imperial Family.!~",

      "description": "__Height:__ 173 cm (5'8\")  \n\nA Britannian-Eleven girl, who believes herself to be a Japanese person at heart. Before the Britannia Empire conquered Area 11, Kallen's original name was Karen Kouzuki. She comes from a prestigious family and attends the Ashford Academy where she receives outstanding grades while serving as a member of its Student Council. When away from the Academy, she fights as an anti-Britannian operative. Also, Kallen helped organize the Black Knights.   Her brother, Naoto Kouzuki, with whom she had a deep connection, was a former leader of her resistance cell before his death.  Both Kallen's stepmother, a Britannian, and biological mother live with her in the same house, but her biological mother is employed as a maid and is often mistreated by both her stepmother and Kallen herself. After her biological mother is arrested for using Refrain (a fictional drug which lets people think they're reliving the past), Kallen changes her views and decides to fight against the Britannian Empire not only for her brother, but to fulfill her new wish for a world in which she can live happily with her biological mother.  Frail and meek, this aspect of Kallen's character was used as a public front to mask her true nature as well as hide her involvement in the resistance.  Kallen leads a double life as a normal Britannian student and as a member of a guerrilla resistance group against Britannia, which is later reformed into the Order of the Black Knights by Lelouch Lamperouge. In school, she portrays herself as a weak-bodied high school student who obeys all of the formalities, and goes by her Britannian name of Stadtfeld. However, her personality changes in to a very strong-willed and forceful one when she acts as a resistance fighter.  As a running gag, Kallen ends up nude or immodestly dressed in front of other people on numerous occasions: Lelouch sees her naked after she pulls back a shower curtain in surprise in the third episode, Suzaku sees her bathing under a waterfall when they are stranded on Kaminejima, she is forced to dress in an immodest bunny costume at the start of the second season (to plant a tracking device on Lelouch), and she walks in on a meeting between C.C. and the Chinese ambassadors wearing only a towel when intending to complain about the previous situation to C.C. (claiming that the operation would've gone faster if C.C. was wearing the outfit).",

      "description": "__Nationality:__ Britannian\n\nMarianne Vi Britannia was the 5th wife of the Emperor of Britannia and the mother of Lelouch and Nunnally. The surname Lamperouge presently assumed by Lelouch was her maiden name. Her commoner status by birth caused her to earn the jealousy of other imperial wives and nobles, which Lelouch suspects had resulted in her murder. Lelouch's investigation revealed, however, that several members of the Imperial House not related to her by blood respected and admired Empress Marianne, such as Clovis, Euphemia, especially Cornelia, who idolized her and put a lot of fruitless effort into investigating the assassination.  It is hinted that her supporters were the Ashford family, which explains why their social statuses were ruined after her death and why they consented to protect Lelouch and Nunnally. She had also piloted one of the earliest Knightmare Frames, the Ganymede, which was developed by the Ashford family and is well known for her superior Knightmare Frame piloting skills, hence the nickname, \"Marianne the Flash\". In episode 23, it is revealed that C.C has apparently been talking to Marianne herself, via an unknown method. In episode 7 of R2, C.C. was talking with Marianne again.  At the end of season one, ~!Lelouch, by questioning Cornelia, discovers that Marianne had ordered Cornelia to shut down the security on the day of her attack, implying that she knew about the attack beforehand.  She is known to have shielded Nunnally during the attack that took her life, however, Nunnally's legs were disabled and she lost her sight. It is also to be noted that her death greatly affected and changes the life of Lelouch, who went on a great length to avenge her death and formed the resolution to create a new world where Nunnally can live in peace.  Because of her death, little is known about Marianne as a person; the side materials paint her as a sweet, kind-hearted woman, albeit one with a rebellious spirit and a deep protective instinct towards her children. Lelouch himself alludes to two such instances, one where she rode a horse into the palace's great hall, and another where she picked a fight with several of the Emperor's other wives all at once. In a flashback from one of the novels, she uses the Ganymede to intimidate a fellow consort who had been cruelly harassing Lelouch and Nunnally - all while maintaining a cheery, motherly disposition with a warm smile on her face. Marianne's conversations with C.C., one-sided in the anime but scripted out by the staff (and actually revealed in the Nintendo DS game), show that she has a playful side, often teasing C.C. when the immortal girl tries to deny any sort of attachment to Lelouch.!~",

Rakshata is not fond of speaking of the past, but it is known that she studied at the Imperial Colchester Institute. She is fairly laid back in most situations, usually seeing laying on a couch when not actively working (one is even installed on the bridge of the Black Knights' flagship, the Ikaruga), and is never seen without her tobacco pipe. She affectionately refers to her technological creations as her \"children\" and treats them as such. She is visibly enraged, a contrast to her normal demeanor, upon learning that Lloyd and Cécile modified her Knightmare without her consent (they are kind enough to credit her for the design, though). Upon the formation of the UFN and the reorganization of the Black Knights as its military force, Rakshata is designated as the Chief of Science, similar to her previous position within the Black Knights.  Rakshata is the creator of the Guren Mk-II and its radiant wave surger weapon. She also developed the Gefjun Disturber, a force field generator that disables all sakuradite-powered technology within its area of effect. This includes Knightmares, though by the second season newer models have countermeasures added to negate the Disturber's effect; only fifth-generation or older Knightmares remain vulnerable. In addition, the field blocks the motion of hadrons, radio waves, and microwaves. This renders anything within the field invisible to radar, and can aid in the blooming of hadron-based beam weaponry. It is named after the Norse goddess of chastity Gefjun.",

He possesses a sword, which he always carries with him. He is also fiercely loyal to the Empress, a trait not shared by any of his superiors. It seems that part of his goal is to reestablish the throne of China as the clear authority, as the current Empress is the head of a puppet government, with eunuchs holding actual power in the country.  Li was formerly a bodyguard for the influential eunuch Gaohai, and accompanied him when he was sent by the Federation as a consul to the Britannian colony Area 11. They arrive right as the Order of the Black Knight's operation to recover Zero began. The Black Knights succeed in their mission and Zero orders the Knights to head to the Chinese Embassy for protection. Gaohai, under the influence of Lelouch's Geass, agrees to harbor the fugitives, which troubles Li as this is not part of their mission.  He meets Karen Kōzuki and is impressed that someone of her age is the pilot of the Guren Nishiki. Later, as the Britannians wait to kill the imprisoned Black Knights, he attacks the embassy himself in an attempt to further his own plans and ideals. After the initial attack, Li holds a private conversation between himself, Karen, and C.C.. He informs them that he plans to kill Gaohai. Under threat by Li, C.C. agrees to let it look like Gaohai died when fighting with them.  Li confronts Gaohai about having recognized the United States of Japan without confirming it with higher officials in the mainland, including the Empress. When he finds out that Gaohai, who is still affected by the Geass, cares more about Zero than the Empress, Li summarily executes Gaohai for committing lèse majesté. C.C. realizes his ambitions, and that his agreement to aid the Order of the Black Knights is only in return for the Black Knights being used as a tool to aid his own plans for China.  Li is in top physical condition and is exceptionally skilled in close combat, especially with swords.

Li Xingke has been described as \"strong as Suzaku\", he's also been described as \"smart as Lelouch\". He is able to quickly discern that Karen Kōzuki is the pilot of the Guren Nishiki Knightmare Frame.  Li displays his intelligence when he deals with the escalating diplomatic and military situation that evolves around the Chinese Federation Consulate sheltering the Order of the Black Knights from Britannia. In addition to not provoking the Britannians to cause an international crisis or possible war, he also uses the unforeseen situation to his advantage to advance his goals and kill the eunuch Gaohai.

Gino is impressed when Kallen defeats both him and Anya in her upgraded Guren Flight-Enabled Version, remarking that her skill is on the level of a member of the Knights of Rounds. He also expresses disappointment at not getting a rematch when she is captured by Li Xingke. He enrolls in Ashford Academy with Anya to learn what it's like to live as a regular person.  During Kallen's imprisonment in Tokyo, Gino visits her and asks if she has any intention coming back to Brittannia under the name of Stadtfeld. The attack on the settlement interrupts their conversation, but he gets his answer when she is set free and joins the battle. She confirms for him that she has chosen the name of Kōzuki, and when asked whether them meeting on the battlefied is a reason to be happy or sad, he claims that they should enjoy it. He then asks Suzaku to let him deal with Kallen himself, but Suzaku insists that she would not let him off so easily and stays to fight her.",

She is a quiet and introverted person with a mysterious past and has a Britannian emblem tattooed on her left arm. She holds the distinction of being the youngest individual ever appointed to the Knights of Rounds at the age of 15. She wants to be remembered, so she maintains a blog which she frequently updates with pictures she takes with her camera-phone. As one of the younger members of the Kights of Rounds, she is close friends with Suzaku Kururugi and Gino Weinberg. Suzaku's cat Arthur also takes a liking to her, though it seems to be more affectionate to everyone except Suzaku himself. Anya maintains a detached attitude in most situations, usually declaring most things to be boring. In battle, her fighting style reflects her heavily-armored Knightmare; she annihilates her enemies with overwhelming force and doesn't hesitate to kill disabled enemies. However, this detached attitude also gives her a lack of common sense; she had piloted her personal Knightmare Frame just for the sake of capturing Lelouch’s hat to gain extra club budgets, disregarding the fact that she was piloting her Mordred in a non-combat area and had aroused the suspicion of the Knight Police, as well as forgetting the fact that she is to be a couple with Lelouch if she gets his hat.",

He claims to be a \"homicide genius\", and carries a number of large knives which he is adept at throwing. He is fiercely loyal to the Empire, but does as he pleases most of the time, even around members of the Imperial family. He pilots the Knightmare Frame Percival.  Luciano commands a unit of personal bodyguards known as the Grausam Valkyrie Squadron, a quartet of young women between the age of 15 and 25 who pilot two-tone pink Vincents. Two of their members are Liliana Vergamon and Marika Soresi, sister of Kewell Soresi. Prior to their appointment to the Valkyrie Squadron, they served under Princess Cornelia.  Luciano first appears shortly before the formation of the UFN; he throws a knife at Suzaku and then insults Euphemia. He later walks in on a conversation between Nunnally and Kallen, telling Kallen that she is to be used as a hostage, and threatens to harm her because her body is expendable so long as she is alive. Gino intervenes, and Luciano insults him by suggesting that his nobility is what allowed him to reach his position. During the second battle of Tokyo, Luciano destroys a number of the Black Knights' Knightmares and nearly kills Lelouch in tandem with the Grausam Valkyrie Squadron. All four Valkyrie pilots are subsequently killed by Kallen, followed by Luciano himself.",

Bismarck attempts to use his Geass, which allows him to see a few seconds into the future, to even the odds, claiming that the only person he ever had to use it on was Marianne. Suzaku's \"live\" command allows him to achieve victory despite Bismarck's Geass, slicing the Galahad in half. Bismarck dies gasping Marianne's name.   (Source: Wikipedia)",
