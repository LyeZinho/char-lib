The only reason that those who use it are called heroes is that they can put up with its annoying habits, such as a list of one-thousand things he demands to be completed, such as daily five-hour reading sessions. Excalibur was first introduced when Kid and Black Star found a book about him and thus sought him out, only to discover that the book had in fact been written by Excalibur himself. They quickly ditched him due to his personality. His other form is completely the opposite given his elegant weapon form, looking like a cartoon-ish gentlemen with an outrageous mustache and no pants. On the other hand, his legendary powers have been proven by a fellow Shibusen student who found completing the appointed tasks easy. Excalibur can grant great power, light speed and teleportation, and the wielder can easily defeat three of Shibusen's strongest combined. In the end, Excalibur was put back again because the student could not put up with his annoying sneeze. His existence throughout the story is purely comical, with the exception of the fact of how he informed Kid, the Thompsons, Buttataki, and Blair about the story of Eibon, backed by Shinigami.

      "description": "The first real witch introduced in the series. She is nothing more than a kid witch that is not very good at magic, which is the reason Mifune is protecting her. She cares for Mifune and calls anyone that fights with him a bully (even if he started the fight). Her animal theme seems to be chameleons due to her hat's appearance, her last name, and the entrance of her castle. She is later shown attending the witch's meeting alongside Mifune, which greatly angers Eruka. The only magic she has shown so far is partial invisibility. She is being held captive by Arachne so that Mifune will fight for her but Angela doesn't seem to know it. In the past she was being used by a mafia family until Mifune was sent to kill her but he 'kidnapped' her instead as to protect her. (Source: Wikipedia)",

Justin is the youngest in the DWMA's history to become a Death Scythe at the age of thirteen, all without the aid of a partner. His weapon form, the guillotine, fits his title of \"executioner\". Justin has the ability to read lips but due to his constant use of earphones and the fact that the Shinigami wears a mask, he cannot understand the Shinigami. He tends to pray and give thanks to God for everything, and also tends to speak loudly due to his constant use of headphones. He travels by means of a dune buggy with a coffin on wheels connected to it. In the manga, he is colored with blonde hair and his hairstyle is a tonsure cut, usually worn by monks from European temples.",
