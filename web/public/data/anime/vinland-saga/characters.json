He's traveling with [Askeladd](https://anilist.co/character/13020), who is the leader of a ruthless group of mercenaries who take jobs from whoever they think can offer them a reasonable reward. Besides, Askeladd is the man who killed Thorfinn's father, Thors, and the only reason Thorfinn is traveling with Askeladd is so he can defeat him in a duel and win back his father's pride. Thorfinn only wants to win his father's pride with a fair duel. Askeladd only agrees to these duels when Thorfinn completes a certain task (like bringing him the head of the opposing armies general on the battlefield).  He does not fight for the love of battle, but is still prone to losing his composure when in combat. This hotheadedness often costs him battles against more experienced opponents.",

Ten years before the main Vinland Saga storyline, Askeladd accepted a contract to assassinate [Thors](https://anilist.co/character/13021), father of [Thorfinn](https://anilist.co/character/10138). During the Viking invasion and war in England, he manipulated Thorfinn's desire for revenge against him as a way of keeping the gifted young fighter in his service. Askeladd is one of the most skilled fighters in the series, and is particularly adept at predicting his opponents' moves in combat. Askeladd shares the name of Askeladden, a Norwegian folk character known for his cleverness.\n\n~!He is half-Danish and half-Welsh, being the son of a Welsh princess captured by a Viking raider. He believes in the legend of Avalon, which inspired him to support Prince [Canute](https://anilist.co/character/17438)'s bid for kingship of the Danes and ultimately sacrifices himself assassinating King [Sweyn](https://anilist.co/character/27957) in order to install Canute as the Danish King and to ensure the safety of Wales from Denmark.!~",

A giant man who loves combat, Thorkell defected from the Danish army to become a mercenary for the English, believing that fighting his fellow Vikings will give him a better challenge. This same love of war leads him to support Prince [Canute](https://anilist.co/character/17438)'s bid for kingship of the Danes. Before [Thors](https://anilist.co/character/13021)' defection he works with and highly respects the man, and bears a fondness for his son [Thorfinn](https://anilist.co/character/10138) in the main plot. He duels twice with Thorfinn and dominates each time, though he loses two fingers in the first duel and an eye in the second. In battle, Thorkell typically wields a pair of axes as his primary weapons, but his greatest asset is probably his vast physical strength. During a skirmish with [Askeladd](https://anilist.co/character/13020)'s band, he hurled a spear with such force that it skewered three men at once, despite having been thrown from several hundred feet away. Thorkell's character is based on Thorkell the Tall, a historical Jomsviking lord who is a mentor to Canute in the Flateyjarbók.   \n\n~!Joined Canute as his servant after seeing him change in front of Askeladd and Thorfinn.!~",
