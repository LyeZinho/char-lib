      "description": "__Occupation__: Middle School Student  \n__Alternate Name__: First  \n__Likes__: Having friends, writing in diary \n __Height__: 161 cm  \n\nThe main male protagonist of the series and the First Diary user. Also known as Yuki (ユッキー, Yukkī), he is a 14-year-old middle schooler who is a rather quiet boy with an anti-social behavior who doesn't talk much. He mostly sees things around him as a bystander and writes it down in his cell phone diary. Yuki becomes involved in the Diary Game when to his shock that Deus, a god-like being whom he thought was an imaginary friend turns out to be real, selects him as one of twelve contestants in a 90 day battle royale where they must kill each other using their special diaries where the last survivor becomes Deus' new heir. Yuki's diary is called the Random Diary, which written from his point of view, gives a detailed explanation of his surroundings very accurately whether it be the present or the future. While versatile in any situation, the main disadvantage of the Random Diary is that it doesn't tells him what is happening to himself which leaves him vulnerable. Furthermore, since the diary is written from his point of view, Yuki can be tricked into thinking something he sees is true without realizing it which is a disadvantage for other people who use the Random Diary.  Unlike most of the contestants, Yuki doesn't want any part of the game as he just wants to live peacefully and doesn't want to kill anyone, but is forced to play to survive and will only kill as a last resort as he is the main target by the other diary users because Deus sees Yuki as his favorite to win. Because he is weak, in order to protect himself, he quickly makes friends and allies to help him including Yuno Gasai, a girl in his class who is madly in love with him and is another diary user. Yuki is kind person yet is naive for quickly trusting people whether they be friend or other diary users as they may have ulterior motives. The most complex relationship he has is Yuno, while Yuno is a formidable ally, her mad obsessive love for him to the point she is willing to kill or use anyone so both of them can survive scares him yet despite the many things she does that shocks him including kidnapping him against his will and learning she killed her parents, Yuki still relies on Yuno in order to protect himself.   ~!Originally, Yuki's main goal was to find a way to end the game peacefully without killing anyone but that goal quickly changes when during the middle of the game, his mother is accidentally killed by his father, who is also later killed by agents of John Bacchus, the Eleventh Diary user. Grieving over his parents death, Yuno seduces and convinces him that in order to bring his parents back to life, he should win the game and once he becomes the new God of Time and Space, he can use his divine powers to bring them back from the dead. With this new goal, Yuki becomes determined to win no matter what including lying, killing, backstabbing and destruction. His new behavior shocks his friends as his and Yuno actions cause a series of terrorist attacks across the city. !~ He is named after Jupiter, the Roman god of the sky, weather and lightning.",

Yukiteru's condition and actions are recorded every ten minutes in her \"Yukiteru\" diary, it also provides small commentary made by Yuno in some of the entries. Its most obvious weakness is that it does not show Yuno's future at all -- her condition, situation, or surroundings — unless it somehow involves Yuki. Working with Yukiteru's \"Random Diary\" diary, however, covers both of their diaries' individual flaws; as it has been said the two make for a perfect combo.  Smart, beautiful and diligent — those who don't truly know Gasai Yuno would simply see the model student role she plays while at school. She is secretly obsessed with Yukiteru and would do anything within her power to assist him. She can be quite clingy and is highly fond of stalking him. When obstacles arise that either endangers Yukki's life or threatens their relationship, her thoughts turn murderous and she lets nothing get in the way of her path. Yuno is also able to quickly analyze and adapt to unexpected situations that may arise, and she puts thoughts into action without hesitation, performing what needs to be done without ever losing her nerves.\n\nShe is named after the Roman goddess Juno.",

Like the Fourth, her \"Escape\" diary goes along with the type of profession she is involved in. Whenever Minene faces a dire situation, the diary will chart out the best course of actions she can take in order to get out of a tight spot. Based on the function of her diary, it might even help reduce the chances of her receiving a Dead End and it is probably one of the best diaries to have in Deus' game of survival. The diary's only shortcoming is that there are some circumstances where the odds are too heavily stacked against Minene to the point where the diary won't be able to secure an escape route for her.   An infamous atheistic terrorist, Minene is a young woman who bears a strong hatred for organized religion, particularly God.    ~!Her hatred of religion stems from her past when she and parents were traveling in a city in the Middle East but got caught in a battle, which is hinted between Israelis and Palestinians, where her parents were killed in the crossfire. Blaming God for her parents death, she leads a crusade of destruction against those associated with God.   Minene got involved in the Diary game when after a failed assassination to kill a Catholic Cardinal, she tried to escape but almost fell to her death but was saved by Deus who gave her an offer to save her if she join his game. Minene's diary is the Escape Diary, which will chart out the best course of actions for her to escape whenever she finds herself in a dangerous situation. While it means she can escape anything, it is not perfect as the diary can only tell her how to escape if there are favorably conditions that allow her any chance to escape.   Originally, she wants to win the game to destroy religion worldwide but later mellows out after befriending Yuki and his friends. While she began as an antagonist against Yuki, she later became his ally, becoming a big sister figure to him and both of them hold no animosity with each other despite Minene was responsible for the destruction and deaths at his school and Yuki was the one who blinded her left eye. She shares an interesting relationship with Masumi Nishijima of the police whom she met during her failed assassination of the Cardinal. While she constantly dismisses all of his attempts to get to know her, she finally relents and eventually falls in love with Masumi.   In the anime, during the last episode it was shown that Minene, from the second world, and Masumi, from the third world live together and have two children. Third world Minene is still a terrorist. !~ She is named after Minerva — the Roman goddess of wisdom, commerce, weaving, crafts and magic.",

Her \"Thousand League Eyes\" diary is unlike the other diaries, as it is a scroll, rather than a cell phone. As its name would suggest, it is able to report the future of all her followers. Unlike Yukiteru's diary, it is not limited to just her surroundings, but also sees far events, such as seeing the events Yuki had accomplished a great distance away from where she resides. Her diary can also record near events; the short-term future that will occur after only a few seconds away from the present. This provides Tsubaki with massive amounts of information to work with. However, it can pose as a hindrance in times where a situation changes constantly or when she needs to react quickly.   ~! She was born with bad eyesight, only able to see a few feet in front of her. Her parents capitalized on this by setting her up as an \"oracle\" and creating a cult around her. After her parents died in a car crash, however, she became a plaything for the Omekata and was even raped by it's members. As a result of her experiences, she has become jaded with the world beyond her vision, and wishes for it to disappear. Tsubaki wants Yukiteru's abilities in order to avoid the prediction her diary made about herself. As she is able to control her worshippers, Tsubaki does not make use of any weaponry. !~  ~!When Yuki and Yuno travel in time to the next world their actions shape a future in which Tsubaki's parents never take their fatal car ride.
