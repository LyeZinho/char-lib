      "description": "__Race:__ Half-Alv\n__Class:__ Enchanter\n__Height:__ 177 cm (5'10\")\n\nShiroe, the main protagonist of the series, was an engineering grad student before the Apocalypse. He's one of the most experienced and skillful adventurers in the game, due to having started playing Elder Tale when he was in middle school. He's also infamous for being a brilliant tactician. He is renowned as the strategist of the Debauchery Tea Party, an informal group that managed to tackle some of the game's most difficult raids. He knows Naotsugu from the time both of them spent with the Debauchery Tea Party.\n\nAs an introvert with asocial tendencies, he would rather not have anything to do with guilds. Which is also because he doesn't want people to use him for his knowledge and skills. However, he doesn't actually hate other people, and he tends sympathize with beginners, especially if they happen to be children.",

She's very loyal to Shiroe for his generosity, and addresses him as \"Master\".\n\nAkatsuki is rather insecure about her height, and hates it when people mistake her for a child (despite the fact that she is about Shiroe's age). She has a habit of kneeing Naotsugu in the face when he says anything perverted.",
