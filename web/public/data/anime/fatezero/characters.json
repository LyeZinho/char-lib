He held the title of Euryphis lecturer within the Clock Tower, a notable mage academy, despite his young age. His magical lineage, going back nine generations, further enhanced his status. His magical abilities were attributed to wind and water, and he is proficient in the magical arts of summoning, alchemy, and spiritual evocation. He is also a teacher of Waver Velvet's, and was responsible for rejecting and tearing up Waver's radical thesis concerning magical potential. This act was in turn directly responsible for driving Waver to, in retaliation, enter the fourth Holy Grail War by stealing a valuable artifact from Kayneth.   Lord El-Melloi is, with regard to magical ability, arguably the most skilled Master in the Fourth Holy Grail War. He excels in magic involving mercury, which he employs to create a variety of attack and defence forms, such as barriers strong enough to resist point blank Claymore Mine blasts and flying blades capable of slicing through stone walls. Lord El-Melloi's mastery is great enough such that his enchanted mercury can react without his conscious control, automatically forming shields against surprise attacks. Kiritsugu Emiya initially regards Kayneth as one of the two most threatening magi involved in the war alongside Tokiomi Tōsaka, though neither are considered the most dangerous to be involved.   He's engaged to Sola-Ui Nuada-Re Sophia-Ri, the daughter of the head of the spiritual evocation division, through an arranged marriage. While Kayneth is in love with her, Sola-Ui despises Kayneth, considering him a coward for not attacking opposing Masters face to face.   Kayneth is the Master of Lancer in the Fourth Holy Grail War. His participation in the War is merely a bid to increase his own prominence within the Magus Association. His initial base of operations was located at the Fuyuki Hyatt Hotel, and protected by twenty-four layers of barriers, numerous summoned monsters, various traps, and mystical spatial alterations in the lobby.

Despite this, he grew disgusted with his family, particularly [Zoken Matou](https://anilist.co/character/16030), and cut all ties with them more than ten years prior to the 4th Holy Grail War. Disappointed with the lack of magical abilities in Shinji, Zoken resented Kariya for allowing the family's magical lineage to decline, especially since a Matō with magical powers was necessary to act as a Master during the Holy Grail Wars.\n\nKariya maintained contact with his childhood friend and love interest [Aoi Zenjou](https://anilist.co/character/16018), though he had willingly given up trying to pursue her affections after she married [Tokiomi Tohsaka](https://anilist.co/character/16017). Aoi would later have two daughters, [Rin](https://anilist.co/character/498) and [Sakura](https://anilist.co/character/500), who were both fond of Kariya.\n\n~!On the last day of the 4th Holy Grail War, [Berserker](https://anilist.co/character/12732) faces off against [Saber](https://anilist.co/character/497), culminating in a battle so ferocious that Berserker draws more mana than Kariya can provide. His Servant killed, Kariya survives long enough to make his way back to the Matou estate, where he is approached by Sakura. He tells her that he has come to rescue her, but collapses at her feet soon after. Kariya dies with a satisfied smile, comforted by dreams of escaping with Aoi, Sakura, and Rin and starting a family together. !~\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

She barely talks to other students in her school and exhibits a desire to be left alone, as exemplified by her tendency to stay on the school's rooftop, away from the rest of the students. She is also secretly a Magus and a Master in the Fifth Holy Grail War. In the beginning of the anime, she summons Archer for her Servant, although she originally wanted to summon Saber. Rin is reared as the successor to her family's magecraft, instructed by her father, Tokiomi Tohsaka, to prioritize sorcery over her own interests. After her father is killed, Rin continues to perfect her sorcery, with some guidance from her guardian, Kirei Kotomine. She strives to earn the admiration of her peers to avoid drawing attention to her private life, even though she is secretly stingy, tomboyish, and a perfectionist. She is perceptive, resourceful and avidly competitive.\n\n~!Rin is Sakura's older sister, but the two were forced to live apart by their father, Tokiomi. Rin once had a good relationship with Sakura before their separation, evident by a ribbon Sakura always kept. Rin later convinced herself that Sakura was living a happier life with the Matou family than she was living as the Tohsaka family heir, and this delusion blinded her to the knowledge that Sakura was only barely keeping her own sanity in check while constantly suffering. Rin went as far as to try to preserve Shirou's life for what she thought was entirely Sakura's sake. Rin had also decided that she would kill Sakura in the events of the Holy Grail War if it came down to it. However, ultimately, she could not bring herself to do it and took the blow without harming her.!~",

Berserker is known to have three distinct Noble Phantasms, as shown on his status page. However, due to the enchantment that obscured his identity, his status page was shown blurred, making it impossible to identify the specific names and natures of his Phantasms, save for the sword Arondight. In addition, this Berserker is uniquely able to make anything he chooses into his own Noble Phantasm and effectively wield them, from telephone poles to the Noble Phantasms of other Servants.\nBerserker's real identity is Lancelot of the Lake. Until his identity was revealed, he had been known simply as the Black Knight.  Lancelot, known as the Knight of the Lake, had been loyal to Artoria, knowing both the king and the secrets of her sword well. Lancelot's downfall began when he loved Artoria's queen. Though the king was actually a woman, Artoria had married in order to present the image of a stable royal family before the kingdom and to maintain the illusion that she was a man in the face of the general public. Her queen willingly sacrificed her own life as a woman in order to fulfill the ideal of the stable government. However, Lancelot and the queen fell in love. Though he wanted to take her away, Lancelot's loyalty to Artoria and his sense of duty to serve the kingdom prevented him from doing so. When political enemies of the king exposed Lancelot and the queen's affair, the queen was ordered to be executed. Left with little choice, Lancelot rebelled in order to try and save her. The knight, the queen, who had made her beloved betray his duty, and the king, who felt responsible for the despair her most loyal servant endured, all suffered. Though Lancelot suffered greatly, he found that he could not hate Artoria, who had never blamed Lancelot for anything regarding the state of affairs they had become entangled in. In his despair, Lancelot desired to become a beast who had no worries; thus, when he became a Heroic Spirit, he became a Berserker-class spirit. !~ (Source: Wikipedia)",

Without informing Kirei as to the true nature of the mark that appeared, they transfer Kirei from the Church to the Mages Association as Tokiomi's pupil. Neither man reveals to Kirei that he can also obtain the Holy Grail, instead telling the young man that he is performing a mission for the Church.   ~!According to Kirei Kotomine in Fate, his father died trying to protect him.

Kirei arrives to find his father dead and his father's final parting gift, and comes to the conclusion that Risei died trying to protect him. Though Kirei sheds tears realizing his father cared about him till the end, he finds himself feeling the same feelings he felt when his wife died - the desire to have seen them die.!~  (Source: Wikipedia)",

He was thus forced to elope with her, and Fionn, driven by jealousy, sent many pursuers after them. After some times, Fionn acknowledged their marriage, and reconciled with Diarmuid. Still, his resentment remained, and eventually drove him to leave Diarmuid for death when the warrior was fatally injured by a boar during their hunting trip.   Even after his death, Diarmuid resented neither Fionn nor Grainne, and regretted only that he could not follow his path of loyalty to Fionn. For this reason, Diarmuid participated in the War, in order to have a second chance of fighting for his master. !~",

True to the legend, she fell in love with Diarmuid under the influcence of his Mystic Face (originated from the beauty mark under his right eye), and placed a geis on him so that he would run away with her on the night of her wedding to Fionn. As Diarmuid considered the geis a test of his honor, and knew that Gráinne fell prey to his curse, Diarmuid accepted her proposal and the two fled, besieged by Fionn's many warriors on the way. Finally, when Fionn accepted their marriage, Diarmuid was overjoyed to return to his service.  During a wild boar hunt, Diarmuid was fatally injured, and nothing but water drunk from Fionn's hands could save him. However, due to his lingering resentment, Fionn let the water slipped from his hands twice, and when he brought the water back to Diarmuid for the third time, Diarmuid was dead.!~",

Jeanne is a special Heroic Spirit summoned by the Holy Grail itself to act as the administrator of the Holy Grail War instead of the Church. Being summoned in the Ruler class also allows her to retain the memories of each repeating \"game\" unlike other Servants.\n\nJeanne d'Arc was a common farmer's daughter. She claims she had received the command of God to fight. She heard the Lord’s lament that the world changed straight into hell. The Lord wept into sorrow as no one could stop it and people were not even allowed to live simply, and were compelled to become either beasts or food. Conflict never ended, and blood continued to rain incessantly and soak the land. She received a revelation from the Lord, the voice contained no glory or victory, no obligation or sense of purpose but only the Lord laments. She caught his small, feeble murmurs that everyone else failed to hear. \n\nJeanne also has a minor cameo in the second season of Fate/Zero.",
