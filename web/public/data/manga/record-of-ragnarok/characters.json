Despite this, he claims that he's always completely serious about any statement he makes.\n\nGrowing up as child, Raiden was viewed a monster by many other kids and became depressed, his mother would encourage him to use his strength for the good of the weak and always hugged him with love. From that day, Raiden took his mother's words to heart and used his strength to help the villagers around him. When the \"Great Tenmei Famine\" began, Raiden became saddened by the death and suffering occuring all over his village and so decided to become a sumo wrestler to raise money for his hometown.\n\nIt is said that Raiden has the strongest muscles in human history and was considered to be the best of all time.",
