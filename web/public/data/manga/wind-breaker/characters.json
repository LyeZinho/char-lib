He appears cold hearted, but very much so cares about the friends he has and his little brother. His minimal expression of emotion doesn't allow him to articulate his feelings very well, but sometimes his few words mean a lot.\n\nJa-Hyeon is a well rounded cyclist. Throughout the competition, he is acknowledged as the ace of the crew. He is able to play as a defensive rider, supporting his crew during their races, as well as a offensive rider. Vinny noted that he enjoyed the \"hunt\" of attacking from the back.\n\nHis debut in the League of Street preliminaries helped him gain popularity in the biking scene in Korea and at his school.",
