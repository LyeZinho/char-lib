She is somewhat reserved in comparison to Meiko Shiraki (the Underground Student Council's Vice-President), wearing underlayers when on guard duty. She is actually very shy and reserved, as shown when she is caught in compromising conditions by Kiyoshi Fujino a number of times. Hana is shown to be quite impressionable out of her tough exterior as in compromising or sexual situations, she faints and becomes mortified.\n\n~!Hana has a fear of mushrooms which as a result of remembering the hospital visit. She develops a crush on Kiyoshi after they kiss.!~\n\n(Source: Prison School Wikia)",

While Chiyo relies on her for advice and mental support as a good confidante, Mayumi is a non-confrontational person and tries to avoid fights - thus inadvertently depending on Chiyo for physical defense and/or protection. Though she does not seems antagonistic towards the boys, Mayumi is apathetic towards Chiyo's interest in Kiyoshi & the enrolment of the five first-year boys in the school. In contrast to Chiyo's love of sumo wrestling, Mayumi shows an interest in clothes and magazines. However, Chiyo is completely oblivious to her disinterest in sumo wrestling.\n\n(Source: Prison School Wiki)",
