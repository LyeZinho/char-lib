But, more importantly, he's a Substitute Soul Reaper.\n\nEver since he was young, Ichigo has been able to see spirits, to the point where he could not tell the living from the dead. Due to this oddity, he would end up meeting [Rukia Kuchiki](https://anilist.co/character/6/Rukia-Kuchiki), a Soul Reaper. Soon after, once a hollow appeared and threatened his family, he recklessly fought back against it, forcing Rukia to save him by taking the blow of it's attack. Seeing Ichigo's determination to protect his family, Rukia offered to temporarily turn him into a Soul Reaper by piercing his chest with her Zanpakutou and transferring half of her power to him. Ichigo goes through with it, allowing him to make short work of the Hollow, and forcing him to fulfill Rukia's role as a Soul Reaper until she can regain her powers.\n\nBeing stubborn, short-tempered, strong-willed, and impulsive, Ichigo often claims not to care about what other people think about him, and attempts to maintain a detached and \"cool\" image. He generally keeps his face set in a near-permanent scowl, with his eyebrows drawn together. His outspoken, hot-headed demeanor is a trait Ichigo himself has acknowledged, and if somebody picks a fight with him, he cannot help fighting back. Ichigo's resolve in battle can waver at times, which can impede his fighting prowess, and he tends to go into a state of depression and self-loathing when he loses a major fight or lets a friend down. Despite what he lets on, he is genuinely compassionate and empathetic towards others, and doesn't mind helping others when they become upset, or need the support. He is always willing to fight to protect those he cares for, no matter what it is he would be fighting against.",

She is graceful and \"clean\", yet is willing to talk to ordinary people. However, her cool and lone demeanor often forces her to hide her personal troubles, even from those close to her. Because of her never opening up her heart, she has difficulty making friends. She can also act like a bit of a tomboy at times, wanting to show others that she's tough and getting aggressive towards others when they insult her. Rukia is clueless about the ways of the modern Human World, often making misconceptions and struggling with the simplest of things like opening a juice box. She likes to climb up to high places and loves everything rabbit-themed, becoming quite sensitive when someone insults her obsession with them. People often have difficulty understanding her drawings, which are typically rabbit-like, and doesn't like it when people complain about their quality.",

She comes off as naive and rather clueless, which is at odds with her exceptionally high marks in school. Although, apparently she is hopeless when it comes to technology. She is also notorious for cooking up and eating strange food at home, although she also likes some normal food. Her favorite food is red bean paste, and she likes putting butter on sweet potatoes. Orihime has a tendency to rush into situations without thinking, sometimes leading to embarrassing consequences, plus she has an overactive imagination and can get carried away thinking of implausible scenarios. Orihime has also demonstrated that she is perceptive, mostly when it comes to Ichigo Kurosaki, who she is deeply in love with. \n\nPreviously, she had lived with her older brother, [Sora](https://anilist.co/character/27739/Sora-Inoue), who was fifteen years older than her. She and her brother were raised by a drunk father and an unfaithful mother, who always argued and beat their children. It is unknown if her parents are still alive. When Sora turned eighteen, he ran away with Orihime, who was three years old, and raised her since. For six years, Orihime and Sora lived in harmony despite the fact that Orihime was bullied in school because of her long hair. One day, Sora gave Orihime a pair of hairpins. However, Orihime refused to wear them because she said they were childish. On the same day, Sora was wounded in a car accident and died in the Kurosaki clinic. Orihime has worn the hairpins ever since. A year after Sora died, Orihime met [Tatsuki Arisawa](https://anilist.co/character/1094/Tatsuki-Arisawa) who defended her from the bullies. They have been best friends ever since.",

Uryuu operates on a moral ethic known as the \"Pride of the Quincy\" and has a strong sense of justice. He has also shown to be very chivalrous, stating that he enacts justice on men who abuse or treat women badly. Uryuu also has a tendency to not use lethal force in battle, especially if he can win without doing so. Instead, he will simply incapacitate his opponent.

Nonetheless, he is treated equally within his group of friends in Karakura (Ichigo, Keigo and Mizuiro). Chad also has a weakness for cute things, like small animals and Kon, and is one of the few characters that actually treats Kon with any dignity but for the most part ignores him. To match his extraordinary size, Chad possesses extraordinary superhuman durability, even before activating his spiritual powers, being able to survive the impact of a falling steel girder on his back and a head-on motorcycle collision, and is strong enough to break telephone poles and wield them as giant clubs, even when already injured. Besides his physical strength, Chad has also shown to be very intelligent; he ranked 10th out of 322 in school, while Ichigo ranked 23rd.",

In terms of personality, Renji is same as any other Shinigami. His personality varies from cocky and eccentric, to being depressed after he's defeated, all the way to being clueless and funny. Although he's carefree and happy character in most of the series, he can be quite serious, especially when it's the matter of life and death situations for either him or people he hold precious.  He is shown to have rather complicated relationship with his captain, Kuchiki Byakuya. Renji sees Byakuya as the goal he has to surpass. First time, when Renji was still in the Academy, he encountered Byakuya and felt something chilling about him. In the meantime, Renji became Byakuya's lieutenant, and throughout the series, Renji starts to see Byakuya not only as rival, but also as man he can look up to.",

Her most distinctive features are her very large breasts, which are even larger than Orihime Inoue's. She also shares Orihime's strange taste in food. She dresses in the garb typical of shinigami, though her robes hang loose enough for her ample bosom to be revealed. She wears a necklace and a pink scarf over her shoulders. In addition, her lieutenant's armband is worn on her uniform's sash, as opposed to around the arm.  Rangiku tends to be a slacker who doesn't like paperwork and loves to drink saké. She's not the least bit modest about her appearance, frequently referring or complaining about her large breasts in casual conversation. She even tries to bribe Ichigo Kurosaki into letting her stay at his house using them, though unsuccessfully. Her easy-going and free-spirited personality is in sharp contrast with the serious Hitsugaya, but the two seem to be quite close, regardless. Rangiku is almost constantly by his side and has shown her loyalty to him on several occasions. While she seems somewhat self-centered, she is sensitive to the feelings of others, evident when she sees the concern Hitsugaya has for Momo Hinamori, the guilt Izuru Kira shares with her when Gin Ichimaru is revealed as a traitor, and when Orihime feels depressed about her role in Ichigo Kurosaki's life. Despite her lackadaisical image, she can be extremely serious when needed. She's shown to be somewhat maternal, especially with Orihime and Momo.   ~!Not much is mentioned about Rangiku's past. She came from Rukongai and was rescued as a child by Gin Ichimaru; the two soon became friends. In one short chapter from the manga, she was once asked by Ichimaru during her childhood when her birthday was. She replied that she did not know because she had been alone for as far as she could remember. This possibly means she was orphaned since birth. When he heard about this, Ichimaru told her that if this was the case, then her birthday should be set on the day they met (the day she was not alone anymore).  It is not known how she became a shinigami or how she became lieutenant of the 10th Division, but it is known that she has held the position longer than her current captain has held his. She first met Hitsugaya in Rukongai when the two bumped into one another. Recognizing his immense power, and the harm it was causing to the old woman he lived with, she convinced him to become a shinigami in order to control it.!~",

She is a hard worker and takes a strong moral stand — she particularly believes in following orders. She is generally reserved and not arrogant like her lieutenant. She will not hesitate in the slightest to strike down even her subordinates if they stand in her way. Soi Fon, like most female shinigami, is a member of the Shinigami Women's Association.   Underneath her standard shinigami captain uniform, Soi Fon wears the special forces leader's uniform, which has no sleeves or covering for the back. The reason the shoulders and the back are exposed is because of Soi Fon's ability to use shunkō (flash cry), an advanced technique that combines hand to hand combat and kidō and causes high spiritual pressure to accumulate at the shoulders and back, blasting away the fabric at the shoulders and back. Her hair is worn short with two long braids covered in cloth.   Long ago, she had a close friendship with Yoruichi Shihouin that went beyond the typical leader/subordinate relationship. When Youruichi left the soul society with no explanation, Soi Fon took it as a personal betrayal of her feelings, with gives rise to her intense hatred of anyone who disobeys orders or disturbs the harmony of the soul society. She finally comes to terms with her feelings toward Yoruichi during the \"Rukia Rescue\" arc, and the two becomes friends again soon after. Soi Fon has borderline romantic feelings toward Yoruichi which becomes evident on several occasions such as when she buys some photos of Yoroichi eating voraciously in skimpy clothing.  Soi Fon also has a personal dislike for Kisuke Urahara because of his close relationship with Yuruichi. Another person she dislikes is her own lieutenant, Oomaeda, whom she punches quite frequently for his stupidity and cowardice.  The correct romanization of her name, as confirmed by Kubo Tite, is Suì-Fēng.",

In spite of his icy and regal manner, Byakuya still cares for and protects those important to him.\n\nByakuya strongly believes in law and order. As a captain of the Gotei 13 and head of one of the great noble families, he works hard for a peaceful society. He feels that if someone in his position does not follow the rules as a good example, no one else will. He believes that to maintain the order, all lawbreakers must be punished, even if it goes against his own wishes.",

District #80 is the worst, most lawless region of Rukongai, full of thieves and murderers (whereas area #1 is the most orderly and law-abiding). While residing in District #80, Kenpachi was nameless. During that time, he became proficient in swordsmanship and killed numerous enemies. At some point during his travels outside of District #80, he found a small girl and named her Yachiru, in remembrance of the only person he ever admired, after she showed no fear of his sword. Yachiru came from area #79, Kusajishi, where her parents were murdered. The two events were apparently quite close. On that day, he also took on a name: Kenpachi, the title bestowed upon the strongest swordsman, the one who has killed the most. The two developed a father-daughter-like relationship.\n\nAlso, at some point (before he became a Captain), he fought and defeated Ikkaku Madarame; for this reason, Ikkaku pledged to serve under Kenpachi from there on out (Ikkaku doesn't actually get the chance to do so until he joins the 11th Division), but Ikkaku would still jump at the chance to fight Kenpachi to the death. After some time had passed, Kenpachi found his way to the Seireitei. He defeated and killed the previous Captain of the 11th Division (whose identity is currently unknown) and gained his seat in the Gotei 13 in this manner. In the anime, his assumption of the Captain's seat caused Maki Ichinose to leave the Soul Society. According to the anime, it is also what convinced Ikkaku and Yumichika to join the Shinigami.",

The spirit of Zangetsu resembles a 30 to 40 year-old man, and Ichigo calls him \"old man\" as a result. \n\nZangetsu is portrayed as wise and calm in most matters, and fond of testing Ichigo in unusual ways, many of which have a purpose completely contrary to the stated goal. Zangetsu has displayed the ability to temporarily close fatal wounds during combat, though whether or not this is a unique ability is unclear. Unlike most zanpakuto, Zangetsu has no release command. The shikai form of Zangetsu resembles an over sized, though more elegant, cleaver blade without a hilt guard. The sword is as tall as Ichigo is, 1.74 meters, and has a black blade with a silver edge. When not in combat, the cloth extends to cover the rest of the sword and falls away when necessary, shrinking back to a manageable size. The cloth can also be used to swing the weapon like a flail and toss it at opponents, but this is rarely done. \n\nThe bankai of Zangetsu, named Tensa Zangetsu (天鎖斬月, lit. heavenly chained cutting moon), is considered completely out of the ordinary for any zanpakutō. Unlike most bankai forms, which usually create some sort of massive creature or effect, Ichigo's bankai actually shrinks his sword down to a daitō (Japanese long sword) with a black blade, handguard in the shape of the manji (which is the kanji for \"ban,\" meaning \"full\"). The cloth wrapped around the hilt is replaced by a short chain with a broken link, similar to that of a plus spirit. In addition to his sword, Ichigo's robe is replaced with a long-sleeved, ankle-length black coat with red lining that is closed at his chest, much like that of Zangetsu himself.    ~!When Ichigo enters the zanpakutō realm while it is in bankai, the spirit of Zangetsu seems much younger, around Ichigo's age. !~ Zangetsu's special ability (in either form) is the getsuga tenshō (月牙天衝, lit. moon fang heaven stab, Viz: Moon-Fang Piercer of the Heavens), which fires concentrated energy blasts from the tip of the blade in the shape of a crescent moon.",

Ulquiorra is also analytical; during his and Yammy's first visit to the human world, he makes several remarks on the humans who confront them. He theorizes that Orihime Inoue's healing power is a temporal-spatial ability, which Aizen describes as the rejection of fate, and comments on how Ichigo Kurosaki's final release can easily get through Yammy's defenses. He also notes Ichigo's power fluctuation, which varies between very weak and stronger than his own. It would appear that Ulquiorra and Grimmjow, the 6th Espada, are not on good terms. While Ulquiorra allowed Yammy to kill anyone he deemed as \"trash\", which included Ichigo, Ulquiorra allowed him to live based on his belief that Ichigo's power was so turbulent that eventually, he would destroy himself. Grimmjow's conflicting viewpoint was that Ichigo should have been destroyed outright, as he could overcome his weakness and grow even stronger. \n\nDespite Grimmjow's argument, Aizen trusted Ulquiorra's judgment. This disagreement led to Grimmjow's unauthorized assault on the real world. Though Ulquiorra is of a higher rank than Grimmjow, Grimmjow is confident that Ulquiorra is afraid to fight him for fear of them destroying one another. When released his zanpakutō, Murciélago (黒翼大魔 (ムルシエラゴ) ,Murushierago?, Japanese for \"giant black-winged demon,\" Spanish for \"bat\") creates two large black wings on his back. His hollow helmet centers atop his head, sporting two large horns, and his arrancar uniform appears more form fitting at the top, becoming robe-like towards the bottom. Additionally, Ulquiorra is apparently unique among the Espada in that he has a second release; Resurrección Segunda Etapa (Spanish for \"resurrection second stage\"). He becomes more muscular with clawed hands and feet, the whites of his eyes turn black, and his helmet is replaced with elongated horns. He loses his clothes; his arms and legs from the hip down are covered in black fur, and he gains a long thin tail. In both forms he can create long \"lances\" of energy called Lanza del Relámpago (雷霆の 槍(ラソサ・デ ル ・レ ラソ パ ー ゴ ) ,ransa deru reranpāgo?, Japanese and Spanish for ”lance of the lightning”), and when thrown can cause an explosion. Ulquiorra seems unfamiliar with the technique when he uses it in his second release state, unexpectedly missing Ichigo with his first one, however, to compensate, he can produce more should his first miss the target.

Wonderweiss is small, thin, and somewhat child-like. What is left of his hollow mask remains on top of his head, and resembles a tiara or small crown. Wonderweiss's personality is also child-like and even autistic. When sent on a mission to kill, he instead plays around with a dragonfly. He shows a bit of hostility, firing a retaliatory bala blast at one point, but quickly reverts back to his regular state after doing so. He isn't able to speak clearly, only saying a few syllables at a time like a child would. Kaname Tōsen says that Wonderweiss, like himself, is a pure being (though he makes a point of wondering whether he is pure good or evil), which often tend to stick together, causing Wonderweiss to follow him everywhere when possible. Also for this reason, he tried to restrain Gin Ichimaru from getting closer to Tōsen, since Wonderweiss was wary of him.  Wonderweiss's zanpakutō is a large purple sword strapped to his back, about as tall as he is. The hilt resembles a western long sword rather than the more common katana, although the familiar hilt weaving is present, whilst the guard resembles an Egyptian eye. The name and released state of his zanpakutō have not been revealed.   ~!It is revealed in the \"Fake Karakura Town\" arc that Wonderweiss is a so-called \"modified arancar\", and that he was specifically created for the sole function of sealing Ryuujin Jakka's flames.

He was revealed as a co-conspirator working for Sousuke Aizen and left Soul Society along with him and Gin Ichimaru. He then became a Commander in Aizen's Army of Arrancar. The Soul Society ordeal put him at odds with his formerly closest friend Sajin Komamura, as well as his former Lieutenant in the 9th Division, Shuuhei Hisagi.    Tousen&#039;s creed in life is to &quot;take the path with the least bloodshed&quot;; it was for this reason that he felt it necessary to follow Sousuke Aizen. Despite this, he knows of Aizen&#039;s plan to create the King&#039;s Key, which will require the deaths of thousands of innocent people. He was also willing to attack and kill members of his own division while acting as the 5th seat, including Hollowfying his own captain. Tousen, along with Gin Ichimaru was identified by Kenpachi Zaraki as being afraid of death, this is later confirmed with him saying he only feared being assimilated into the Shinigami culture and dying a pointless death. His own description of himself as a &quot;pure being&quot; when explaining why Wonderweiss Margela likes him shows degrees of pride and arrogance as well. Also, despite stating many times how much his friend loved the world, he himself never said so, and in fact hated the world that took away his friend. As Captain of the 9th Division, which is charged with the editing of Seireitei Communication, Tousen was the chief editor of the journal. He himself wrote a serialization titled &quot;The Path of Justice&quot;, which was not very popular, until he began to publish cooking recipes in his articles, which made them more popular among female Shinigami. This also indicates that his speciality is indeed cooking, his favorite dishes being chicken stewed with carrots and other sophisticated ones. He does not like pickled food. Tousen also has several unique relationships with the Arrancars. Tousen thinks of Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez in the same manner as Kenpachi Zaraki; a killing machine that will cause only more bloodshed in the world. Wonderweiss Margera seems to have a great affection towards him. Tousen explains that this is because they are both pure spirits, and that pure spirits tend to attract and follow each other. !~",

      "description": "__Height:__ 192cm (6'3\")\n__Rank:__ Captain of the 8th Division ~!Later, Captain-Commander, Captain of the 1st Division!~  \n\nKyoraku is a laid back and flamboyant man, evident in his style of dress and general attitude. He wears a straw hat and a pink flowered haori over his captain's uniform. Although his haori and obi sash are cheap, his pinwheel hairpin is very expensive. In his off time, he can be seen drinking sake and napping. Other times, he likes to chase after women, which is noted by Yasochika Iemura of the 4th Squad when commenting in his diary. In particular, he often flirts with his lieutenant, Nanao Ise, whom he calls 'my Nanao-chan' (little Nanao).\n\nHe is close friends with 13th Division Captain Jushiro Ukitake, with whom he graduated from the shinigami academy and works with often.  Kyoraku tends to use a more familiar speech style than most other characters in Bleach. He generally refers to his fellow captains and shinigami by their first name followed by an honorific, and is the only character who dispenses with honorifics when addressing General Yamamoto, calling him old Yama (Yama-jī). Even Ukitake, who was also taught by Yamamoto, does not do this.\n\nKyoraku is a peace-loving man who will always try to talk his way out of a fight. However, he does not wish to insult his opponents by not fighting, either, as he explains to Chad. Since he has achieved the rank of captain, it is implied that he must be a powerful fighter, but the true extent of his abilities has not been seen in the anime. General Yamamoto states that Kyoraku and Jushiro Ukitake, both of whom he trained himself, possess \"greater powers on the battlefield than any younger generation, or old,\" suggesting that the two are more powerful than any other captains, with the possible exception of Yamamoto himself.  The slightly eccentric Kyoraku also seems to like making an impression on opponents.\n\n ~!After Shigekuni Yamamoto-Genryuusai died, Jirou Souzousa Shunsui became the captain of the 1st division.!~",

      "description": "Kon primarily serves as a comedic foil in the series; when not inhabiting Ichigo's body, his normal plushie body is treated with little respect and much disdain. The humorously cruel treatment he is always subjected to provides the comic relief in Bleach. One of the only people who gives him any respect is Chad; however, Chad ignores him most of the time. His plushie body is a knock-off of the main character of the popular TV show Carnivore Kingdom, named \"Ponkichi\", which happens to be Chad's favorite show. It was a prize from the shooting game in the Karakura Town Festival.[2] He is constantly stepped on and torn, at which point Ichigo will have Uryū Ishida repair the plushie. Uryū usually adds something unwanted or unnecessary when doing so, such as dressing Kon up like a designer doll. Uryū also sewed a Quincy cross on the back of Kon's head as revenge after Kon attacked Uryū for turning him into a doll.  Kon is quite perverted and often takes advantage of his form to get girls to hug him to their chests, which rarely goes as planned. After Ichigo becomes less dependent on Kon to transform, Kon comments on how he wouldn't mind taking Ichigo's body out for a spin again, saying that he'd like go peeping and pulling up skirts because, as he puts it, \"It's [Ichigo's] reputation that gets sullied\". Kon is very fond of Rukia, calling her \"sister\", though this extends to basically any pretty girl.  Kon is a special type of soul pill called a \"modified soul\" or \"ModSoul\". When inserted into a body, an aspect of the body is made superhuman, which in Kon's case is enhanced speed and strength. Because of the shady origins of the ModSoul, the soul society called for the destruction of all ModSoul pills, but luckily, Kon was shipped out with a load of regular soul pills by mistake. This gives rise to his belief that everyone should be given a chance at life and should not be killed merely based on the circumstances of their origins.  His name \"Kon\" comes from the word \"ModSoul Konpaku\", another name for \"modified soul\". Though Kon wanted his name to be \"Mod\", Ichigo disagreed for the same reason that Kon liked it, it sounded too cool.  Theme songs: \"Nichiyoubi Dansu\" by Kuuki Koudan (Kon Theme #1) and \"Bushman\" by Rip Slyme (Kon Theme #2)",
