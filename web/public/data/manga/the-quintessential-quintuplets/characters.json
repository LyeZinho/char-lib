      "description": "__Height:__ 178 cm  (5'10'')\n\nFuutarou is the main protagonist of the 5-toubun no Hanayome series.\n\nHe is a student of the Asahiyama High School. He lives with his father, Isanari Uesugi, and younger sister, Raiha Uesugi, in a small apartment. He is a serious and hardworking high school student and a prodigy at the top of his grade. Because of his family's perpetual poverty, he takes up the offer to tutor the Nakano quintuplets.\n\nFuutarou is noted to have a big ego and high confidence. He is straightforward, tactless, and rude; but is actually capable of holding back his emotions. Despite that, Fuutarou could momentarily lose his composure when agitated and faced with unfavorable circumstances. He also initially did not like getting involved with other people's problems, finding them to be troublesome. Despite his tactlessness and crudeness, he is knowledgeable enough in knowing what to say in specific situations when thrown at him; rarely giving up when trying to achieve a specific objective.\n\nDespite his egotistical nature, Fuutarou is very hardworking and has a very high amount of patience; especially when getting the attention of the quintuplets and tutoring them despite various amounts of failures and setbacks. He later on shows a sense of duty strong enough to help the quintuplets in their studies despite them not paying him immediately, even though the money that came with tutoring was the initial reason he accepted the job. He also begins valuing their relationship to the point where he would do things outside of their tutor-student relationship which would later on bloom into a bond where they mutually support each other with little question.",

She passed away five years prior to the start of the story on August 14 from an unknown terminal illness and her death was a shock to the quintuplets!~",
