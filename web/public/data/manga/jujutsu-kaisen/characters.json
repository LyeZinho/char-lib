He then became furious at Mahito and the other cursed spirits for manipulating him into harming Itadori.!~\n\n~!Chousou is one of nine death painting wombs that came from a woman capable of giving birth to cursed spirit children. At some point, Chousou and his brothers were stored at the Jujutsu High, along with some of Sukuna's fingers.\n\nAs stated by Chousou himself, Noritoshi Kamo, the man who experimented on his mother is in fact his third \"parent\" due to him having mixed in his own blood into Chousou when his mother was pregnant with him. Although seemingly not remembering much about his own past, it is evident that Chousou himself remembers Noritoshi and holds a grudge against him for toying with his mother and siblings' lives.!~",
