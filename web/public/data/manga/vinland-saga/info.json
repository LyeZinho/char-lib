  "description": "As a child, Thorfinn sat at the feet of the great Leif Ericson and thrilled to wild tales of a land far to the west. But his youthful fantasies were shattered by a mercenary raid. Raised by the Vikings who murdered his father, Thorfinn became a terrifying warrior, forever seeking to kill the band's leader, Askeladd, and avenge his father. Sustaining Thorfinn through his ordeal are his pride in his family and his dreams of a fertile westward land, a land without war or slavery … the land Leif called Vinland.\n\n(Source: Kodansha USA)\n\nNotes:\n\n- Won the Grand Prize at the Japan Media Arts Festival in 2009.\n\n- Winner of the 36th Kodansha Manga Award in the General category in 2012.",
