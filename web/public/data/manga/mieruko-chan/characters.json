Her Spiritual-Awareness power overpowers her sight, like the reflection in glass is overpowering and you're unable to see what lies beyond it.\n\nShe tries to have a stoic exterior when confronted with spirits, but is internally frightened by them. She also cares deeply for her friend [Hana Yurikawa](https://anilist.co/character/139632/Hana-Yurikawa), using her power to protect her in various ways, such as diverting her from certain routes with spirits and bringing her food when she was sick with a form of spiritual drainage. Miko prefers to ignore the spirits and she denies seeing them whenever she is confronted by others for her talents.\n\n(Source: Fandom Wiki)",

He was given the name \"Romm\" by his former master, Mitsue Takeda, as part of the tradition of adding a 2nd name to apprentices.\n\nRomm has been seen to be very bold, running a business geared only to those adapted to seeing spirits. Even though many have called him a fraud, Yuria Niguredou believes in his ways and has been roped into buying some of his products. He is also very mischievous, taking amusement in the unpredictable actions made by Miko Yotsuya. He enjoys teasing Mitsue Takeda.\n\n~!Shindou was brought to Mitsue as a child, and she took him in as her apprentice. She trained him in the art of the occult, and he received his stage name, Shindou Romm. Much to Mitsue’s dismay, Romm grew much more powerful than her, and she doubted her ability to teach him. Although she tried to keep him safe, his curiosity got the better of him and caused him to wander into very dangerous places, such as into the hands of the Bell Ghost.!~",
