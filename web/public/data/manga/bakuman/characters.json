His assisants were initially Nakai and Fukuda (Mashiro also worked for him temporarily before Detective Trap was serialized). His editor is Hattori Yujiro. He once demanded to be allowed to end one series he hated if he ever made it as the most popular author in Jump.   Niizuma is slightly naive, but can also be serious and calculating when he wants to. Eiji tends to act conceited because he is hailed as a genius; however, after working on Crow for quite a long time, he grew more humble, even claiming to not be \"good enough of a Mangaka to be judging other people's work\" when asked by his editor to judge for the Golden Future Cup. (He judges anyway, but is not very helpful, only expressing his interest in Ashirogi and Ryu Shizuka). He tends to make noises and sound effects when drawing or writing his manga. Eiji is constantly chastised by his editor, and at first seems to be rather oblivious towards his rivals' feelings towards him, even expressing great excitement when he meets Ashirogi Muto and saying he is their fan. He is a great lover of manga and his opinion are valued by everyone at Jump, including his rivals. He refers to himself as an \"Eternal Boy\" and that is why he writes Shonen manga. He has only ever had a crush on one girl, back in elementary school, which paired with his naivet'e most likely explains his lack of success in the Super Leaders' Love Fest.",

He is very fond of Takagi and Mashiro and continues to be interested in their progression as mangakas, offering off-hand advice to Miura when he can. Hattori is editing One Piece.

Fukuda had already won an honorable mention when he tried for the Tezuka Award and also got seventh place in the same issue of Akamaru Jump in which where Ashirogi's Money and Intelligence ran and got third place. Later, Fukuda competed with Ashirogi and Nakai in the Golden Future cup with his original manga, Kiyoshi Knight.   Later, Fukuda successfully serializes Kiyoshi Knight, quits his job as Niizuma's assistant, and gains a new assistant named Yasuoka. His editor is Yujiro. With the serialization of Kiyoshi Knight, Fukuda became an aspiring rival to Ashirogi, Eiji, and Nakai. Among these three, he is considered to have the worst drawings, though they apparently match his stories. His drawings often border on grotesque.   Fukuda is rash and often seems fueled by his emotional swings. He's very competitive and enjoys the competition between him, Ashirogi, Eiji, and Nakai. Along with all of this, he's also rather conceited, but at the end of the day is a very good friend (and rival).    ~!Despite the relative longevity of Kiyoshi Knight, Fukuda is unsatisfied with the series and concludes it, starting Road Racer GIRI to compete with his rivals. Road Racer GIRI gets off to a good start as soon as it is released, though Fukuda frequently remarks that he needs to get people who wouldn't \"draw such crappy bikes\". Fukuda's Road Racer GIRI ranks higher than Ashirogi's PCP on several occasions, maintaining a high ranking that is able to compete with and surpass Niizuma's +Natural. After the Love Fest, in which Fukuda is angry at placing second to last out of seven for his love manga, GIRI receives an anime offer, stunning Fukuda and causing him to gratefully thank Yujiro with formalities. !~ \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

On hearing Takagi and Mashiro talking about drawing manga on the subway and finding an abandoned copy of Jack, he quit his job to be a mangaka because he thought it would be less work for him. He is a different kind of genius compared to Eiji because he is talented even though he just started to write manga more in of a spur of the moment.   After teaching himself to draw manga in a very short amount of time, his manga, Otters 11 is serialized. He is hailed as a genius by Koji Yoshida who pushed for his serialization saying that Hiramaru had no real motivation to continue as a mangaka and failure would just make him quit.   Hiramaru is extremely lazy and immediately regrets getting serialized due to the amount of work to keep up a weekly series. He has said that he doesn't know why people have to work for a living and that he wants to sleep when he's tired and to eat when he's hungry. Due to his laziness, his editor, Koji Yoshida, often schemes to manipulate Hiramaru into working. Hiramura often tries to escape Yoshida to avoid working. His attempts to escape Yoshida is a long-running gag in the manga.   He is also a chronic hypochondriac and often makes incredible claims of illness. However, he is always proven healthy by the doctors. It's mostly believed that his \"illnesses\" are not only a product of his own fears, but also serves as an excuse to avoid work.   Hiramaru has a huge crush on Aoki Yuriko. Yoshida bribes him into doing work by giving him weekly facts about Aoki. Yoshida also often depicts dramatic scenarios of Aoki rejecting him due to his laziness or inability to produce names to energize him to work hard. Because he can't stand the idea of losing Aoki in his life, a combination of his own anxiety and Hiramaru's end-game scenarios, he works feverishly in hopes his work will earn Aoki's heart.    ~!Eventually, he gets engaged to her in Chapter 160. !~",
