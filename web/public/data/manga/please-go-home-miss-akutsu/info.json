  "description": "Timid Ooyama keeps to himself at school, and he certainly never gets involved with Akutsu Riko, a delinquent as buxom as she is notorious. But when she turns up at his apartment out of the blue, what’s he supposed to do, kick her out? She’s gorgeous! And scary! But things get complicated when Akutsu asks to stay the night, then starts turning up over and over again after school–reading Ooyama’s manga, sprawling out on his bed, and digging up his smut stash. Why exactly is she claiming his life as her hangout?! She makes it clear there’s no way she could possibly like him, but the teasing threatens to boil over into something more in this sexy yet adorable slice-of-life rom-com!\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
