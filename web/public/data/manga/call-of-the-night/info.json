  "description": "One sleepless night, Ko slips out to walk the streets. Life after dark is a revelation! When flirtatious Nazuna invites Ko to spend the night at her place in an abandoned building, he’s stoked! But then he awakens to kisses on his neck with a little too much bite to them... Is it just the delicious taste of his blood that makes her meet him night after night for late-night adventures, conversation and...naps? Or something else? Then, when a cute girl from Ko’s past shows up and competes for his attention, his budding relationship with the undead is put to the test!\n\n(Source: Viz Media)\n\nNotes:\n\n- Seventh place of Tsugimanga 2020 Award in the Manga Category and first place of Daruma 2023 Award (France) in the new manga category (released in 2022 in France).\n\n- Includes three extra chapters.",
