He's reasonably well-liked by the ladies, so when he encounters a girl he can't easily charm, he can't get her out of his head (currently, he can't get Mitsuki and Aya out of his head, but more in the sense that he's watching over them). If someone says something mean to him, he'll smile while actually getting depressed on the inside. However, he bounces back ridiculously fast. As far as his club activities go, he's in the soccer club (but he's probably the type who gets invited to all kinds of clubs).",
