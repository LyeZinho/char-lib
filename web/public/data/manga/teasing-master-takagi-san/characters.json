She also has noticeable anger issues, as she quickly becomes impatient when bothered or pestered by others. Regarding her relationship with Nakai, she often second-guesses herself while trying to interact with him. She wishes that Nakai would show more interest in the relationship, but loves him regardless. They are seen happily watching the fireworks together at the summer festival, showing that the two are able to enjoy each other's presence despite their issues with each other.",
