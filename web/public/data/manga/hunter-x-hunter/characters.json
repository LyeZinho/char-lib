      "description": "__Height:__ 158 cm (5'2\")\n\nKillua is a member of the Zoldyck family, who are all legendary assassins. Since birth, he trained endlessly in the art of assassination. He eventually ran away from his family and profession to participate in the Hunter exam. He befriended [Gon](https://anilist.co/character/30/Gon-Freecss) almost immediately and has loyally followed him since then. Killua is usually a kind-hearted and playful boy, but once provoked he becomes extremely violent and bloodthirsty. This seems to be a trait he got from [his father](https://anilist.co/character/60/Silva-Zoldyck), who believes that Killua would eventually return home as an assassin. He is also a transmuter and constantly strives to improve his nen ability, developing many interesting techniques as the show progresses.\n\n(Source: Hunter x Hunter Wiki)",

These scarlet eyes were known to be beautiful, being one of the seven most beautiful things in the world. Because of this, the Kurta tribe was constantly pursued and eventually massacred. The eyes of the tribe members were all taken away during the massacre. Kurapika is so far the only known survivor with a heart bent on revenge.

      "description": "He was the most powerful offspring of the Chimera Ant Queen. He was known as the \"__King__\" (王, Ō) of the Chimera Ants, and served as the main antagonist of the Chimera Ant arc.\n\n~!Meruem is first seen when he violently rips through the womb of the [Chimera Ant Queen](https://anilist.co/character/83183/Chimera-Ant-Queen) from the inside, ready to emerge into the world and unwilling to wait for a natural birth. Shortly after his birth, Meruem leaves the hive and NGL with the Royal Guards, in search of a place to start his kingdom. He descends on the Republic of East Gorteau and takes over over the country by killing its dictator, Ming Jol-ik. Meruem then uses Jol-ik's corpse as a puppet to order East Gorteau's population of approximately five million to gather simultaneously in the capital city for a national rally. This however, is a ruse, designed to create a situation where entire towns and villages could be secretly abducted for a \"selection\", the forcible awakening of nen, without their disappearance being noticed.\n\nMeruem's eventual plan was to take the one percent of the population that would survive such an awakening and turn them into soldiers for an army he will use to conquer the world. This plan is temporarily disrupted by [Killua](https://anilist.co/character/27/Killua-Zoldyck), who assassinates a number of \"selectors\", but a backup plan is soon implemented; East Gorteau is put under martial law, and the population undergo selection in their own homes, though this slows down the process considerably, and only 500,000 people are processed, with 5,000 predicted survivors. Soon after this occurs, the Hunters [Netero](https://anilist.co/character/14489/Isaac-Netero), [Morel](https://anilist.co/character/29806/Morel-Mackernasey), [Knuckle](https://anilist.co/character/29809/Knuckle-Bine), [Shoot](https://anilist.co/character/29807/Shoot-McMahon), Killua, and [Gon](https://anilist.co/character/30/Gon-Freecss) attack the palace, with the intention of separating the Royal Guards from Meruem and assassinating him.\n\nMeruem's initial personality, when he his first shown in the story, is that of arrogance. The Queen's intention to give birth to a perfect offspring is reflected in Meruem's mentality. He considered himself superior to all other forms of life and felt no concern for his dying mother after his \"birth.\" Meruem was also merciless, instantly killing any chimera ant he considered disrespectful. Meruem was seen killing and eating other chimera ants, something no other chimera ant had ever done.\n\nAfter reaching East Gorteau and putting his plans into motion, Meruem took an interest in various board games, and gathered various champion-level players to his palace. Simply by reading the rule books, Meruem was able to master any game in under ten matches, simultaneously learning from his opponents while disrupting the \"flow\" of their play style. After defeating the best player for each game, Meruem proceeded to kill them, as they were of no further use to him.\n\nThe final game Meruem learns is Gungi, a fictional shogi-like board game invented by East Gorteau. The world champion for the game is Komugi, a seemingly dimwitted blind girl; However, as Meruem played against her, he found himself unable to disrupt her flow, while at the same time, the challenge of playing against Meruem caused [Komugi](https://anilist.co/character/14313/Komugi)'s skills to increase. Much to the shock of the Royal Guards, Meruem even starts show respect for Komugi and concern for Komugi's well being. In one instance Meruem rips his left arm off, as an apology to Komugi for asking her to bet her left arm on a game, to which she replied that she always bet her life. In another instance, after watching Komugi's nen suddenly awaken, and realizing she would grow exponentially stronger, but only in terms of Gungi, Meruem momentarily decides that his power of \"violence\" was the strongest type of strength, and ultimately Komugi's abilities are meaningless; Yet, moments after this decision, Meruem finds Komugi under attack by a large bird of prey, and is unable to bring himself to do anything except protect her, ultimately unable to understand his own emotions toward Komugi. This leaves Meruem in a contemplative state, wondering about the purpose for his existence in the world.\n\nAs of chapter 290 of the manga, Meruem is preparing to battle Netero, who attacked his castle in order to assassinate him. Before the battle, Komugi is gravely injured by a nen ability meant to cause confusion within the palace, and Meruem orders [Neferpitou](https://anilist.co/character/12300/Neferpitou) to save her life. The way Meruem is drawn in this scene suggests he has learned what it means to have concern for someone else's well being.\n\nHe and Netero then travel to a remote location that was once used for military weapons testing, so that they may both go all out in their fight. However, in a surprising twist, Meruem refuses to fight the Hunter. Through a short conversation between the two, the King reveals that he finally realizes that he should use his power to protect the weak, seeing from Komugi that there are humans who deserve to live; Netero counted among them. He also expresses a desire to remake the world so that everyone is so equal, the term \"equality\" would become obsolete. Netero realizes that Meruem is dangerously caught between his Ant instincts and his humanity, and at this point, either facet of his psyche could win out. Knowing that he has a mission to carry out regardless, and not wanting his heart to waver, Netero suddenly assaults Meruem first with a devastating attack.\n\nMeruem possesses a nen ability that allows him to absorb the raw aura of nen-users he has killed. By devouring their brain, he adds their aura to his own--further increasing his power. His fighting ability is such that even Netero, chairman of the Hunter committee, expresses doubt that he could defeat him.!~\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

When residing inside a corpse, Ikalgo can use a special kind of giant fleas as rounds for the gun; they have a vertical leap of 200 meters (approx. 656 ft 2 in), and their saliva contains anticoagulant properties so potent that not even Killua was immune to it. The flea bullets boast impressive range and muzzle velocity and are powerful enough to knock an unaware individual back a few meters. Furthermore, their trajectory did not appear to change in the slightest when Ikalgo was targeting Killua. However, they do not appear to be capable of killing the target directly, managing to draw blood but not proving lethal even when hitting a critical area such as the neck. This would be in line with Ikalgo's reluctance to kill. The fleas can be conjured only if Ikalgo is puppeteering a corpse; if he is not, he can conjure regular bullets.

As his role progresses during the chimera ant arc, Morel shows himself as an experienced and resourceful fighter, which is shown in his fight against Leol wherein he uses his pipe as a snorkel so that he could allow himself to breathe underwater, and in doing so suffocates his opponent with the Carbon Dioxide he had emitted. The smoke that he uses are for his nen ability, able to take on various shapes and could act independently to him once commands are issued.\n\n##  __Morel's Abilities:__\n\n~! __Deep Purple__ (紫煙機兵隊ディープパープル Purple Haze Soldiers)\n_Type: Emission, Manipulation, and Transmutation_\nThis ability allows Morel to transmute his aura into smoke and to manipulate it in any way he sees fit. With the aid of his giant pipe, he produces great amounts of smoke which he can then shape in countless constructs, such as ropes, grass, hoses, rafts, rabbits, dolls, and even replicas of individuals fully capable of speech and with remarkable strength and speed, although physical contact with them will expose the trick. Smoke constructs can also be told apart from living beings with En, although not with general aura sensing. Morel can change the color of the smoke to make the created objects seem more realistic, even using them to blend into his surroundings, as well as modify their durability to the point they can become virtually indestructible. The versatility of Deep Purple is such that Morel boasted he had yet to meet a Nen user with a more flexible ability.\n\nHis most complex creations are the Smoke Troopers. Morel can emit cores wherein he puts simple Manipulation commands, such as to attack defensively and retreat when encountered by an enemy, before covering the cores with smoke and mold them into his Troopers, which then start acting automatically. It is possible that the cores are not always required, as Morel was able to create Troopers directly from his exhaled smoke. In this case they seem to operate by taking direct orders from Morel rather than relying on preset commands. Alternatively, it is possible that Morel can form the cores remotely, at the same time as he shapes the smoke into constructs. Morel can create a maximum of 216 dolls. By sacrificing quantity to gain quality, he can compress that amount to 50. These dolls then become more complex than his regular dolls, and Neferpitou admitted their quality was superior to the one they controlled. Deep Purple caps Morel's aura output. Dispelling the constructs enables Morel to retrieve the aura he poured into them and utilize it again.\n\n__Smoky Jail__ (監獄ロックスモーキージェイル)\n_Type: Manipulation and Transmutation_\nMorel encases himself and the opponent in an impenetrable barrier made out of smoke. The barrier appears to be unbreakable both from the inside and the outside, as Menthuthuyoupi was unable to damage it with his regular attacks as well as his explosions. Only particle-sized bodies can cross it. Since the smoky aura is detached from his body, Emission might also be involved in the ability.!~",

      "description": "__Nen Type:__ Conjuration\n\nKnuckle Bine is an Unidentified Beast Hunter and Morel's apprentice. Despite appearing to be an aggressive man, Knuckle is very compassionate and easily moved to tears. Knuckle also gets along well with animals, having the habit of taking care of abandoned pets.\n\n __Knuckle's Abilities:__\n\n~! __Hakoware__ (天上不知唯我独損)\n_Type: Emission and Manipulation_\nHakoware involves Knuckle emitting an indestructible mascot called the \"Amortizing Power Redirector (A.P.R.)\" (\"Potclean\"; ポットクリン, Pottokurin, in Japanese) onto the opponent after being dealt a blow from Knuckle. A.P.R. constantly lends Knuckle's aura to whomever it is attached to, displayed by a rising counter on its forehead. When adding interest, A.P.R. announces \"It's time, adding interest\" (「時間です。利息が付きます」, Jikan desu, risoku ga tsukimasu). As long as A.P.R. is attached, any attacks done to Knuckle by his opponent return aura to him, lowering the counter. Until all of the aura lent by Knuckle is returned to him, he cannot be physically damaged by his opponent. The reverse is also true: each of Knuckle's blows only lends more aura to his opponent, causing no damage. The stronger the attack, the more aura is lent or returned. In both cases, the person suffering the blow can still be knocked back by it, despite suffering no damage.\n\nThe interest rate on A.P.R. is 10% of the borrowed aura, accrued every 10 seconds while the victim is within 50 meters of Knuckle. As the amount of borrowed aura (including interest) accumulates, A.P.R. also grows in size. When the aura borrowed from Knuckle exceeds his opponent's total remaining aura (specifically P.O.P), the opponent \"goes bankrupt\". Thus, it is in Knuckle's interest that his opponent spends/wastes as much aura as possible, as quickly as possible (so long as said aura is not spent on Knuckle himself). The result is that the opponent's \"aura balance\" falls that much quicker until it is below the amount they owe Knuckle (displayed by A.P.R), at which point they can no longer possibly repay their debt and bankruptcy sets in.\n\nBankruptcy causes A.P.R. to transform into the \"Individual Ren Suppressor (I.R.S.)\" (トリタテン, \"Toritaten\"), a demon-like mascot that follows the debtor for 30 days and forces them into a continuous state of Zetsu. It is worth noting that when Knuckle struck Shaiapouf's copy, A.P.R. was attached to the latter's real body rather than to his clone. Furthermore, Knuckle can use Hakoware on multiple targets at once, as well as track their general location at all times, regardless of the distance. The ability can be removed by an Exorcist, but it takes a great deal out of the Nen remover. It is also cancelled if Knuckle is rendered unconscious.\n\nIt is unclear what Nen types are involved in the ability; A.P.R. (and later Toritaten) might be conjured and rendered invisible to non-users, which would increase the aura cost, or emitted and possibly transmuted. Regardless, Manipulation would likely be required to endow the construct with sentience (and possibly to enforce Zetsu on the target), while Emission might be involved in the process of lending aura to the opponent.!~",

He is also a former member of the Zodiacs with the codename Rat. According to Ging Freecss, Pariston's personality is similar to Netero's and his own in that he likes to play around and enjoy himself, uninterested in winning or losing, which makes him very unpredictable. He always appears cheerful with a bright smile, making it quite impossible to read his thoughts and calculate his motives. This alone infuriates the Zodiacs, mostly Cheadle, Kanzai, and Cluck. He is extremely sly and gets pleasure from destroying what he loves most. Simultaneously, he is infuriated by and enjoys a rivalry with Ging; Pariston has rarely hated anyone, though he does awful things to them and is curious to see what he would do to someone he hates, with Ging currently occupying that position. He has a preference for harsh punishments for anyone who does him wrong. He tends to treat serious situations as mere games, such as the elections for the 13th chairman. When he wins the chairman position, he casually hands it to Cheadle and resigns. He has also 5,000 cocooned Chimera Ants for his private playground.\n\nDue to his extreme unpredictability, slyness, shadiness and the tendency to test anyone's patience and temper, he is disliked by all of the Zodiacs and many Hunters in the Association, even more than Ging. Even Morel states that he would rather die than vote for a slew rat-like Pariston. It is also shown that Netero also cannot stand him and often gets into a lot of arguments with him, but he tolerates Pariston's presence because he believes that a yes-man second-in-command is too boring for him. Pariston became a Hunter in preparation for Beyond's expedition to the Dark Continent. Three years before Netero's demise, Pariston was appointed Vice Chairman of the Hunter Association, partly because Netero enjoyed how Pariston challenged him, and made him a member of the Zodiacs. During his time as Vice Chairman, Pariston handled the business side of the Hunter Association. During those three years, 18 Hunters went missing, an average of six per year, in contrast to an average of 0.6 Hunters per year prior to Pariston's term, which also included Ging. Pariston declared that if he became Chairman, that number would go down, implying he played a part in the mysterious disappearances, although he may have done so only to irritate Mizaistom,[1] who suspects that Pariston has ties to the underworld. Other shady dealings include a scandal in which funds from the Temp Agency established by Pariston were found in his account, which he claims was all a misunderstanding, as the money was supposedly a reserve fund to strengthen the Hunter Association. Through his Temp Agency and position as Vice Chairman, Pariston succeeded in acquiring a firm grasp over the organization, obtaining the power to control the Review Board from the shadows and thus give jobs only to his supporters.",

(This rivalry is only present during the original anime).  \n\nWhen interviewed by Netero for the final stage of the Hunter Exam, his personal code of honor prevents him from fight Gon and Killua, who he sees as children, no matter their combat ability. His first battle in the fifth stage of the test is against Hisoka, who he can not even scratch, despite having a lifetime record of not a single man being able to withstand one hit by him. After a whisper in his ear by Hisoka, he admits defeat, and his next fight is against Leorio.  ~!However, before the fight can start, Killua suddenly pierces Bodoro's chest from behind with a razor sharp hand, killing him.!~",

The ability has 3 steps:\n- Welfin establishes a target.\n- The missile is loaded with a question or an order.\n- If the target lies or defies the order, the attack begins.\n\nIf all the steps are executed correctly, the missiles continuously chase the target until they hit, even if Welfin himself can no longer sense the target. However, it is possible for the ability to misfire, which occurs when Welfin incorrectly identifies the target. Furthermore, the ability does not prevent the target from attacking Welfin except through deterrence, which means that if they are willing to be hit by the missiles, they will be able to strike first. The ability also has a long set-up and is difficult to use stealthily, since it requires a verbal exchange. These weaknesses led Welfin to look down on Missileman, prompting him to use it only in negotiations.\n\nThe missiles explode upon impact, implanting live Black Centipedes (黒クロ百足ムカデ, Kuro Mukade) in the target's head instead of dealing lethal damage. The centipedes grow by feeding on the target's defiance, inflicting excruciating pain until they kill the target. Should the target attempt to kill Welfin, the centipedes will instantly grow to fatal size, causing the death of the host and preventing them from carrying out their attack. Welfin himself is unable to remove the centipedes once they are inside the target. However, his feelings of defeat and sincerity harm the centipedes to the point that they can kill them, causing them to disappear. Welfin himself was originally unaware of this aspect of his ability.!~",

He is also extremely self-confident, causing Tubeppa to view him as arrogant. Despite that, he is sociable as he is seen amiably talking with two elderly guests at the formal party. He treats his soldiers with respect and honors the memory of the deceased ones.\nHis ultimate goal is not only the throne of Kakin, but the unification of the world under Kakin rule. To achieve it, he has no qualms about killing his own siblings, which he in fact sees as a duty in order to maintain the \"tree\" of the royal family healthy. In particular, he seems to hate Tserriednich, while also having a sort of rivalry with him, and is determined to kill him with his own hands. Despite Tserriednich thinking lightly of Benjamin's intelligence, Balsamilco believes this to be a byproduct of his impulsiveness and tendency to take the shortest route to a goal but regards him as flexible and logical once he has been supplied the necessary information to act upon.",
