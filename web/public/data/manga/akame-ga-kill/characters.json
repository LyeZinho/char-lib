She initially appears very serious and cold-hearted, but she is actually caring and worries about the safety of her comrades. She has a younger sister named Kurome, who is a member of the Jaegers, and loyal to the Empire. Her Teigu is the One-Cut Killer: Murasame, a katana known for being coated in an immensely deadly poison that could kill those cut by it within seconds, as the poison itself has no antidote.\n\n ~!When she was a child, her parents had sold both her and Kurome to the Empire. There, they were placed and raised as Assassins from childhood. Akame in particular became infamous enough to earned the top rank in the Imperial Assassin Division. At some point, many of her comrades had died and she become dissatisfied and resentful towards the government. It was not until she was sent to kill former General Najenda that Akame finally defected to the Rebels after being swayed by her.!~",
