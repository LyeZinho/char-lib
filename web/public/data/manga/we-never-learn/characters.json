She is a blue-haired girl whose dream is to be able to reach for the stars just as how her mother dreamt of studying the stars. Her father is a professor and teaches Math, but she genetically relates to her mother where they both can't do math. Along with being one of the main heroines of the series, she teaches Yuiga about the feelings of a woman, not knowing that she would later fall for him in the series. She is quite insecure with her chest size, and tends to hurt anyone who makes fun of it, such as Ogata comparing her test scores in which she thought it was a comparison between their chests.",

Can drive at \"normal levels\" in which it frightens Yuiga) is part of her overall personality. Being a person who isn't close to her parents, she was once a professional skater until she abruptedly stopped due to the fact that her parents had the expectation of being a skater when she only wanted to be a teenage schoolgirl. She tends to give out tough love by sending out mixed signals. She is also abhors cockroaches and had asked Yuiga to stay with her while getting rid of the cockroach with the promise of doing anything for him. Even mentioning cockroach would make Mafuyu scared that she has to interrupt anyone from saying the animal outloud.",
