      "description": "Susumu Nakoshi is a middle-aged man living in his car. Spending his time between a park full of homeless people and upper-class complex hotel, he is chosen by Manabu Ito to be an experimental guinea pig because he is neither an egocentric wealthy guy, nor a pitiful homeless man. He is \"just between\".  After the Trepanation he is able to see the \"monster\" in each human being, things that frighten or obsess people. By studying the human nature and facing the other's fear, he'll try to understand his own person thanks to this strange and worrying 6th sense. When he is stressed or depressed he jerks off and eats his own semen to prove if he is still \"alive\".",

      "description": "Manabu Ito is a rich medical student who is well-versed in the matters of human psychology and physiology. However, his greatest concern is in performing a surgery known as trepanation. To do this, he seeks the ideal patient, Nakoshi, who lives a life of balance. Nakoshi accepts to be his experimental guinea pig for money. Ito claims that the procedure involves drilling a small hole into the skull, and allows for a sixth sense to develop, ~!though later maintains that his goal was to expose the idea as suggestive development (the placebo effect).!~",

According to him she was able to see homunculus too, albeit differently then him. Her drawings showed a person's true heart; Nakoshi's looked a pure white cloud.    ~! She becomes a slut, under the name \"Nanami\" who sleeps with many men although she lies to Nakoshi and claims that it is business related. Like Nakoshi she had plastic surgery done. When Nakoshi looks at her homunclus, it appears as faces that continually changes to people he has met before and a faceless ghost form. He theorizes when her face changes, she is lying.!~",
