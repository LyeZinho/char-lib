  "description": "When young adventurer Laios and his company are attacked and soundly thrashed by a dragon deep in a dungeon, the party loses all its money and provisions...and a member! They're eager to go back and save her, but there is just one problem: If they set out with no food or coin to speak of, they're sure to starve on the way! But Laios comes up with a brilliant idea: \"Let's eat the monsters!\" Slimes, basilisks, and even dragons...none are safe from the appetites of these dungeon-crawling gourmands!\n\n(Source: Yen Press)\n\nNotes:\n\n- Nominated in the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th Manga Taishou Award in 2016-2019.\n\n- Ranked first in the 2016 Kono Manga ga Sugoi!
