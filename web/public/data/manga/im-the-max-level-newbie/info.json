  "description": "Kang Jin-Hyeok, a gaming streamer, and content creator is the only person who has cleared the game, [Tower of Trials]. However, as the game’s popularity declines, it becomes increasingly difficult for him to continue making a living as a content creator. Jinhyeok prepares to end his 11-year-long relationship with the game and say goodbye to his humble group of subscribers. But on that very day, the Tower of Trials appears in reality with a message saying that humanity will perish unless all players clear each floor within 90 days. Jin-Hyeok, who knows the game better than anyone, decides to use his knowledge to his advantage and dominate the tower. It’s time to show everyone what a hardcore gamer can do!\n\n(Source: Tappytoon, edited)",
