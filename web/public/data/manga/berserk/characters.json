Despite Farnese's childhood abuse and her forcing him to burn his own mother at the stake, he cares deeply for his half-sister. Serpico was her servant since she found him beaten on a snowy street over a decade ago.   Serpico's relationship with Guts has forever been plagued with animosity, due in large part to the dangers that inevitably surround Guts and anyone he takes into his Band. After a duel with Guts in the underground pillars of Vritannis, Guts spared his life. Their bond rekindled, and Serpico has since learned to trust Guts to protect Farnese when he can not.   Serpico uses two items blessed by the wind spirit Sylph in order to battle with tolerance alongside Guts: a rapier that can generate razor sharp gusts of wind; and a cloak that constantly generates a swirling vortex around its wearer which can deflect projectiles, assist in jumping, and slow falls from great heights.",

Puck can secrete a powder from his wings to quickly heal wounds and can emit a bright flash to blind enemies. On occasion, he also resorts to his \"Bloody Needle\" attack, tossing a spiny object resembling a seed pod at someone. It deals no injury, but is painful enough to prompt most victims to cry out. Puck was the first to join Guts's journey, and is starting to show a strange attachment to the Behelit Guts took upon his battle with the Count.  Puck often serves as comic relief along with Isidro. The two are frequently drawn in an exaggerated manner. He is very angry when he ever is mixed up with a Pixie or Fairy quick to state the difference. He also seems to have a brother-sister relationship with the newest comic relief character the female elf Evarella.",

Since this position has been traditionally held by a woman, Farnese was appointed during her stay at the convent she was sent to by her father, Federico Vandimion.   A bit of a pyromaniac (and possibly a pyrophiliac), Farnese's habit of maniacally burning things she didn't like, along with her lack of empathy due to her poor upbringing provoked her to hunt down and burn supposed witches and pagans at the stake. This fueled a secret sadistic pleasure that she constantly tried to deny.   She and Serpico left their Holy See positions after her faith was shattered during the devastation of Albion and the events surrounding Griffith's reincarnation. She then chose to follow Guts in hopes of learning more about the world and has changed into a more sympathetic human being. Since then, Farnese has begun to study witchcraft under Schierke's tutelage. Farnese also seems to have developed a crush on Guts which becomes evident in chapter 287 and 288 of the manga.  Farnese is primarily Casca's care taker and thus rarely involves herself in battles. She and Casca both received enchanted chainmail shirts made of silver as well as a silver short sword for protection against creatures from the astral plane. During Ganishka's raid on Vritanis, she also received a trio of snake-like homonculi created by Schierke from thorn vines which Farnese remote controls with a vine ring.",

After a series of events, Schierke was forced to leave her home and Flora behind forever when they faced an attack Griffith ordered. Schierke, having lived a sheltered life, doesn't like the Human world or the Holy See's religion, but she finds life outside bearable due to her companions.   Her magic skills and knowledge of the world are impressive for a child her age. One of her most used and handiest spells is the ability to hypnotize or temporarily desensitize others. But due to her youth, she tends to exhibit dangerous overzealousness. Her ability to sense \"Od\" (life force or spirit energy) means she can sense the power, intent, and alignment of all creatures and artifacts.  As she sees Isidro as an incompetent monkey, there is some friction between the two, which frequently lends itself to comic situations. Though she initially couldn't stand Guts, Schierke has developed a slight infatuation with him and both now share a father-daughter relationship. When Sonia gave her an offer to join the Band of the Hawk, Schierke thought of Guts before declining. Their journey together constantly brings them into even deeper understanding.",

He wields a powerful sword that, when stuck down his throat, becomes a terrible, Behelit-coated blade capable of slashing rifts through reality itself, thus allowing the Skull Knight to move freely around the world or even between different dimensions.   This enigmatic knight saved Guts in more than one occasion, notably during the infamous Eclipse which saw Griffith become a member of the Hand of God or when Slan almost slaughtered him, though he never explained why, simply declaring that the Struggler (the way he calls Guts) has to keep following his fate. He was the wearer of the Berserker's Armor, and knew the witch Flora. During the duel between Griffith and Ganishka he suddenly appeared out of thin air through a dimensional rift, trying to land a fatal blow on the Hawk, only to see it diverted on the writhing body of the Kushan Emperor.\n\n~!It is heavily speculated that, during his life as a mortal, the Skull Knight was in fact Gaiseric, the warlord that unified the Midland and became its first Emperor, notorious for his helmet whose shape was that of a human skull and whose ambitions 'prompted God to send four Angels' (most likely the four members of the Hand of God) to punish him.!~",

Her motivation for doing so was the legend of a child named Peekaf who believed himself an Elf and in doing so lost his human parents. She refers to herself as the Queen of the Elves and her true form is a monstrous female Luna Moth. Dwelling in the Misty Valley, she terrorized a nearby village, sending an army of insect demons disguised as elves to eat the town&#039;s livestock and people, as well as capturing children that she transformed into more insect demons via cocoons. \n~!Guts, Puck, and Rosine&#039;s former friend Jill travelled to the Misty Valley to confront Rosine, who offered to make Jill an elf apostle. Jill was tempted by the promise of flight, but was uneasy with the warlike ways of the elf demons who would kill each other for fun. Guts found and destroyed the elf demon cocoons, and an enraged Rosine battled Guts until she was so badly injured that she could no longer fight. As Guts was about to deliver a killing blow, Jill shielded Rosine with her body. It did nothing to stop Guts, but before he could act, Jill&#039;s father arrived and shot him with an arrow. Guts was then attacked by the Holy Iron Chain Knights, led by Farnese. Mortally wounded, Rosine finally understood the moral of Peekaf&#039;s fable and in her delirium attempted to return home to her parents but ultimately succumbed to her injuries and fell from the sky to her death.!~",

When the Band of the Hawk attacked Doldrey as part of Midland's regular army during the One Hundred Years War, Gennon became so obsessed with capturing Griffith to the detriment of his greater military objectives. Chuder lost the battle, in large part because Gennon overrode the military command structure and took direct control of Chuder's forces, which was all in Griffith's plan. In his final moments, he pleaded with Griffith, telling him that all he wanted was to have him back. This plea fell upon deaf ears as Gennon was killed by Griffith after the main part of Chuder's army fled the battlefield following the death of General Boscone at Guts's hands.!~",

While it at first appears to be a demon or evil spirit of some kind, it also appears to Guts inside Godo&#039;s cave which evil spirits cannot enter. This would seem to imply that it is either a hallucination or otherwise a part of Guts&#039; mind.    The Hellhound might be the embodiment of Guts&#039; own rage and hatred at the God Hand, the Apostles and especially Griffith after the Eclipse. Among other things, it wants Guts to kill Casca so that he can get back to seeking revenge.     The fact that in the past (volume 5, chapter 3: Wind of Swords) Casca shouted in anger to Guts that he is just a &quot;mad dog&quot; it is probably the reason why his inner beast is represented as the Hellhound.     When Guts uses the Berserker armor, the helmet appears very similar to the Hellhound&#039;s head. The Hellhound appears to be strengthened by repeated use of the armor, but is held in check by Guts&#039; affection and loyalty for his companions. These two forces are constantly at odds: in his latest appearance, the Hellhound seemed larger and stronger than ever, but was bound by thick chains. However the Hellhound has vowed should the time come when Guts was too weak to subdue him, the Hellhound would break free and take over Guts and kill all those Guts held dear.",

He&#039;s the main antagonist in the Tower of Conviction, hindering with his excessive religious zeal Guts&#039; efforts in saving Casca. His symbol are four torture wheels, embodying his willingness to use torture as a way to cleanse people from evil.    [/b]Life[/b]    Mozgus, prior to the events told in the Resurrection Arc was a zealous Inquisitor, acting on behalf of the Holy See. There he recruited a small group of marginalized, disfigured individuals, comforting them by reading parts of the Holy See Doctrine, meant to reassure them that even their disfigurements were meant to be worn with pride as a gift from God, and training them in his particular brand of torture, vicious and rarely leading its survivors to walk away without serious wounds.    He is then sent to St. Albion to root out heretics on the behalf of the Holy See, requesting the Holy Iron Chain Knights as his personal guard. Albeit a true heretical group is brewing in the mountains surrounding St. Albion, based on orgiastic rituals, Mozgus himself apparently does little to stop them, managing to capture many of them only by Farnese&#039;s intervention. Instead, he sets every bit of his attention towards smothering in blood and torture the rebellions of the poor and starving population of St. Albion against the tyrannical rule of the Holy See. Mozgus sees such acts of defiance against himself as defiance against God, whose rule he&#039;s meant to embody.    Physically tall and strong, harsh and demanding with everyone, even himself, he impresses Farnese by smothering several rebellions with threat of death and torture, sparing only a young mother asking more food for her starving child. Though Mozgus does give the child food and medical attention, he sentences the woman to torture with a tearful prayer that she survive the &quot;test&quot; that God has prepared for her, and attempting to use the encounter as a lesson to Farnese about the harshness of God&#039;s doctrine.     ~!Upon capturing Casca, mistaken as a witch by the local heretics and priests alike, he realizes how the recent accounts of the Black Swordsman may be related to the mute, amnesiac branded girl, so, as usual, tries to torture her as a way to get some more information. Instead, he merely triggers the appearance of a huge band of demons, attracted by the Tower itself, chosen place for the Incarnation Ceremony, and the presence of the Brand. Mozgus doesn&#039;t flinch at all, instead closing himself in the chapel of the Tower of Rebirth, where the Apostle-Behelit uses his venom to turn Mozgus and his servants into Apostle-spawns with angelic features, as a way to hasten the Incarnation Ceremony.    Without ever knowing what befell him, Mozgus believes that his angelic wings, his increased stamina and the growing of a scaly hide able to withstand blows from the Dragonslayer and Guts&#039; arm cannon were gifts from God, and decides, as a way to stop the Ceremony and quell the population&#039;s fears, to burn Casca at the stake, forcing Guts to come out.    After an heated battle against his mutated servants, Guts himself is almost defeated by Mozgus, until he manages to drive his sword into the only weak spot in Mozgus&#039; hide: a small, weaker plate with the Holy See insignia, a representation of the Holy Book he always brings with him. Shortly after his death, the Incarnation Ceremony is completed, with Griffith&#039;s rebirth and the total destruction of St. Albion.!~     _source: http://berserk.wikia.com/wiki/Mozgus _",

Although he was killed before he could be seen without his armor, it can be inferred that his physique was very muscular due to the excessive size of his weapon, as well as the incredible size and weight of his armor.\n\nBazuso was a violent and brash man. He was greatly arrogant and seemingly viewed himself as superior to his foes, taunting those reluctant to attack him and loudly goading his enemies right in front of him. He bore an insatiable drive for combat and possessed incredible physical strength, which allowed him to easily slay anyone who challenged him. However, after Guts emerged as the victor of their duel and mortally wounded Bazuso, he attempted to yield before Guts finished him off.\n\nBazuso's strength and fighting ability became infamous throughout the battlefield. It is said that he once successfully took on over thirty men in combat, earning him the moniker of \"Thirty-Man Slayer\", and that he defeated a bear by himself, both of which were testaments to his incredible physical strength. Bazuso was strong enough to send men flying with a single swing of his battleaxe, even when using just one arm.\n\nBazuso wielded a large battleaxe during his fight against Guts. Due to his fearsome reputation, one can assume that he was very skilled in wielding it. Furthermore, the size of the battleaxe complimented Bazuso's height, giving him a wide reach in combat.\n\nPlaced in charge of a fortress under siege by a band of mercenaries, Bazuso leaves the group frozen in fear on sight, intimidated by the immense reputation of the battleaxe wielding man. As Bazuso taunts his enemies, Guts, a young independent mercenary, puts himself forward to remedy the problem; he tells his employer that he will kill Bazuso in exchange for seven pieces of gold. Though Bazuso intends to humor Guts in accepting his duel, expecting to kill the young swordsman with little effort, the ensuing battle is fought on equal terms. After an exchange of blows, Guts is fortunate enough to be able to damage Bazuso's battleaxe and deliver a powerful slash to his waist, forcing the colossal man to his knees. In his final moments, Bazuso attempts to yield for his life; Guts quickly drives his sword down into the neutralized man's head, splitting it half-way, one of Bazuso's eyes dislodged from the impact. It is Guts' triumph over Bazuso that earns him the attention of the Band of the Falcon, and more specifically, Griffith.",

Soon after the Tower of Conviction was destroyed, she apologised to Luca for all the trouble she had caused, but soon left afterwards with Joachim, who survived the fall from the cliffs.",

      "description": "Roderick of Staufen, the third prince of the island nation Eath is the childhood friend of Magnifico and the fiancé of Farnese.  As a sailor, he sees vast potential in the exploration of the seas, unlike his peers, who focus internally to the point of stagnation. As part of Magnifico's plan to join the Vandimion name with the royal Eath family, Roderick agreed to be Farnese's fiancé. His obvious motivations for this arranged marriage are the vast opportunities and support the Vandimion name could bring him, but he seems to take a personal interest in the heiress as well due to her reputation.   Roderick has been used as a way for the author to delve into Guts' deeper psyche by asking him questions about himself and Casca. Guts approves of his naval prowess, as indicated in the fight against the pirates. It is not known whether Roderick is in love with Farnese, but he does try to win her affection, even in the delicate matter concerning her own affection for Guts.   Roderick, with his long black ponytail, his good looks and devil-may-care attitude, is an excellent charmer and a decent swordsman, and demonstrates a willingness to fight the demons, even though he is ill equipped to take them on. He is currently ferrying Guts and company aboard his ship, on their way to Skellig.  Roderick and his crew also have a claim to fame on the high seas: His ship, the Sea Horse, downed 5 Tudor vessels on its own, thus earning Roderick the title of \"Prince of the Seas\".  He and Isidro think very much in the same line in presence of women.",

She appears stiff and stoic around her father, and recoils when he attempts to touch her. Despite Puck's fear of her, she quickly assures him she won't harm him and that she knows what it's like to live in a cage, before opening up to him about her life. Describing the change her father went through seven years ago, she states that her mother was killed by a band of heretics, inspiring the demonic change in her father and his appalling bloodlust.\n\nSoon, Puck has to leave in order to help Guts, but assures her that he will come back. However, before Puck can fulfill this promise, Theresia leaves her room on her own, inspired by Puck's own freedom, and walks in on Guts' battle with her monstrous father in Apostle form. Terrified and with her worst fears confirmed, Theresia runs away, but is taken hostage by Guts, who uses the opening presented to blast the Count's face apart and cleave off his head. Theresia cries while Guts torments her father viciously, though it is unknown if she feels he is going too far or is simply overwhelmed by the events.\n\n~!Theresia is quickly reduced to hysterics as the God Hand arrive, being suggested and pushed as a sacrifice while Ubik shows her and everyone present the truth of how her mother died: the Count's wife was discovered in a pagan orgy of her own accord while he was gone, and unable to kill her, he sacrificed her to the God Hand to escape his sorrow and become an Apostle. Theresia is nearly sacrificed, but the Count cannot bring himself to do it, and she witnesses him dragged off the to Abyss and, as the real world rematerializes around her, sobs over the human corpse of her father.\n\nTheresia considers suicide and attempts it after being goaded by a dispassionate Guts, only for Puck to intervene. Nearly falling off the cliff, she is given a foothold by Guts, who brings her back onto the ledge. Regardless, she angrily blames him for killing her father and ruining her life, and swears she will have revenge on him one day. Guts cockily takes this in stride, reminding her that she now has a reason to continue living, though deep down he is saddened by what he has turned Theresia into.!~",
