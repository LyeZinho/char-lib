  "description": "Kim Rok-Su has one life motto: “Let’s not get beat up.” But after dozing off somewhere midway through the novel “Birth of a Hero,” he wakes up as Cale Henituse - one of the minor villains in the novel who gets the beating of a lifetime from soon-to-be hero Choi Han. Only time will tell how much longer he has before that dreadful encounter. Can Kim Rok-Su change the course of this story so he can enjoy a long and lavish life free of the soon-to-be hero?\n\n(Source: Tappytoon)",
