      "description": "__Relatives:__\n- Deruth Henituse (father)\n- Drew Thames (deceased mother)\n- Violan Henituse (stepmother)\n- Basen Henituse (younger step-brother)\n- Lily Henituse (younger half-sister)\n~!- Albert Crossman (sworn brother)!~\n\n__Occupation:__ \n~!Supreme Commander of the Allied Armies (formerly)!~\n__Affiliations:__ Henituse Family, Roan Kingdom\n\n Cale‘s original personality was that of a spoiled brat. His mother died when he was very young and his father remarried and created a family he didn't like. He used to be a 'good boy', but he began acting 'trash'-y at the tender age of 8 and started drinking when he was 15. Though he liked to cause trouble, he still afforded respect to his family and the few people whom he saw worthy enough to be treated like human beings (such as his butler Ron). Cale never forced himself upon women and defended women as well, although he originally loved to drink every night until dawn. He also never beat up innocent people, only throwing (and always missing) his alcohol bottles at gangsters while drunk. \n\nThe current Cale is just as lazy as the old Cale and wishes to live his life as the “trash” of the count's family in comfort. He has others do many things for him so that he does not have to get involved with the storyline, but somehow, he always gets involved in one way or another. He is still a very kind and gentle person to those he is close to and can be worldly-wise and generous. Sometimes he can give advice, motivate, or comfort people with his words without realizing it. He claims to dislike getting personally involved in fights, as he prefers to surround himself with strong individuals. He thinks even paper cuts hurt, let alone actual sword-fighting. In conflicts, he always seeks to keep casualties to a minimum. \n\nCale is the type of person who would take responsibility in order to not have to take responsibility. He also often is unable to directly speak his true feelings of care and concern for the people he cares about but when asked about it, he would be unable to deny it. Cale doesn't realize that his actions in pursuit of his dream of a slacker life are equivalent to making the world a better place. He will also never admit to feeling sorrow or pain and would blame all his feelings on the failure to become a slacker.",
