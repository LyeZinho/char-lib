After his return to the past upon the failure of clearing the Shadow World, he resolves to strengthen his allies so that the future doesn’t get repeated. In Hebrion Academy, commoners are frowned upon and put into the Beta class whilst the nobles are designated the alpha class, Desir is one of the commoners who hates the class system and wants things to change. As a result he and his friends set out to close the gap by showing the teachers and aristocrats that commoners can have as much potential as the nobles if given the right circumstances.",

Later on in the it is discovered that Romantica is the illegitimate child of a baron and the only reason that she has the title of a noble is that her mother traded her life so that Romantica wouldn't have to live the impoverished \"commoner's\" life.
