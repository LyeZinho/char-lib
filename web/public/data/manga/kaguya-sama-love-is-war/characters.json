Due to the way she was raised, she instinctively looks down on others and thinks of ways to use them for her own benefit. Kaguya rarely interacted with other people before she joined the student council, but that has begun to change. She is an incredibly sheltered girl, resulting in her lacking in several pieces of what might be considered common sense. She still doesn’t understand love very well, and her main objective is to make [Miyuki Shirogane](https://anilist.co/character/121101) fall in love and confess to her.\n\nLater in the series: ~!She confesses her love to Miyuki Shirogane and they start dating.!~\n\n ~!In a Oshi no Ko special chapter, it was revealed that she married Miyuki and changed her surname to Kaguya Shirogane!~",

      "description": "__Height:__ 175 cm\n\nHe is a second year student at Shuchi'in Academy and the president of the student council.\n\nMiyuki is a handsome young man with blond hair and blue eyes. Due to his constant sleep deprivation and nearsightedness, his eyes appear to glare. He usually wears the regular Shuchi'in Academy black male uniform adorned with the Aiguilette, the golden chain-like accessory around his neck. The Aiguilette symbolizes his authority as student council president.\n\nShirogane is a diligent student who, despite his underprivileged background, climbed his way to the top of his class through hard work and determination. Shirogane holds himself in high regard, consistently working to maintain his perfect image. He is textbook workaholic, enjoying his part-time job and often putting his own health at risk for the sake of his work. Due to his poor background, Shirogane values money greatly and goes to great lengths to not be wasteful, and generally dislikes expensive gifts.\n\n~!Miyuki's mother left his family when he was a child. Miyuki's father's factory was shut down and currently has no stable employment. They live in an apartment that costs ￥50,000 (Approx $450) a month. Due to this grisly past, he has been led to a lifestyle of part time jobs and hard work. He passed the Level 2 Kanji Kentei exam and has passed Grade Pre 1 on Eiken. He has also got second place on the National mock exam.!~\n\n~!Miyuki transferred into Shuchi'in Academy during his first year of high school on a scholarship. His first week was a disappointment in that a great majority of his peers were condescending to him because of transferring in. Miyuki was being recruited to serve as the new student council general affairs officer by the Previous Student Council President and helped clean up a swamp. There, he saw Kaguya Shinomiya saving a girl from drowning. It was at that moment where he was truly charmed by Kaguya. At the advice of fellow student council member Momo Ryuju, he adopted the confident genius personality he is shown to have at the story's beginning in order to attract her.!~\n\nEven though he is obviously in love with Kaguya Shinomiya, her wealth and talents greatly intimidates him, leaving him utterly terrified at the idea of confessing to her. He fears that all of his actions will lead Kaguya to look down him, causing him to overthink in many situations. Shirogane has never had a girlfriend and thus is actually quite clueless when it comes to romance, though his dignified demeanor leaves most of the students to think otherwise. Although he excels at studying, Shirogane has proven to be painfully talentless in a variety of other activities, such as sports, singing, dancing and more.\n\nDespite this, Shirogane is unwaveringly kind and virtuous, never putting any of his goals above the well-being of others. He is extremely supportive and generous, willing to help any students with their problems, and will put aside his quest to get Kaguya to confess if it even has a chance of hurting someone else.",

He's also terrified of [Kaguya](https://anilist.co/character/120649), though no one else is sure why that is. Yuu keeps to himself and rarely speaks up, often getting into trouble when he does. He has a depressed outlook on life while having an inferiority complex. In contrast to his attitude, he is willing to help those in need and will sacrifice his pride if need be. Unlike his high school self, he had a much different outlook and demeanor during middle school.\n\nLater in the series: \n~!Ishigami develops a crush on Tsubame that he inadvertently confesses his feelings for her at the school's cultural festival. Ishigami does not realize that his actions were perceived as a confession by the rest of the student body and is therefore oblivious to the implications of having given Tsubame a heart-shaped gift (considered akin to a confession in Shuchiin tradition). After some convincing by Kaguya, Tsubame decides to seriously consider Ishigami's confession, with her original intention being to let him down as gently as possible. It isn't until Ishigami watches Tsubame's performance of the traditional play that gave rise to the aforementioned tradition that he realizes his actions had unintended meaning. Even then, Ishigami's thickheaded nature prevented him from recognizing the full meaning of his actions: a straight confession!~\n\n~!On the day of the third years' graduation ceremony, Tsubame finally has an answer for Ishigami's proposal. Despite Ishigami doing his best to convince Tsubame to accept him, Tsubame ultimately rejects Ishigami. Tsubame promises Ishigami that the two of them will remain friends and Ishigami sees her off with a smile and a gift of flowers. Afterwards, Ishigami breaks into tears, finally learning what heartbreak is like.!~",

She easily succumbs to pressure and while she does put up a front to others, she has very self-deprecating thoughts when it comes to her abilities. She's an honest and earnest person, who is very diligent and persistent even in the roughest of times. Also, she tends to place all responsibility on herself when it comes to others as she is the one who has the most experience in the show business world. She also hates bell peppers.\n  \n~!After the events of the Sweet Today Drama adaptation, she secretly develops a crush for Aquamarine.!~\n\n~!She longs for someone to look at her for who she is now and praise her efforts, someone to say that its okay for her to be here. And after the new B-Komachi's first concert, that person becomes Aquamarine after he waves her respected colored glow stick. Only reinforcing Kana's resolve to make Aquamarine fall for her.!~",
