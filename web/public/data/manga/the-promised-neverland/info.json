Good food, clean clothes and the perfect environment to learn—what more could an orphan ask for? One day, though, Emma and Norman uncover the dark truth of the outside world they are forbidden from seeing.\n\n(Source: Viz Media)\n\nNote: Nominated to the 22nd, 23rd, and 25th Annual Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize.",
