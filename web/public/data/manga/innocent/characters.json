      "description": "Charles-Henri Sanson is one of the main characters and protagonist of Innocent series. Born in 1739 to Charles Jean-Baptiste Sanson and his first wife Madeleine Tronson, he was the fourth in a six-generation family dynasty of executioners.\n\nCharles is described as a beautiful young man with straight long dark hair. Older Charles has longer and wavy hair that is usually always shown to be slicked back. He resembles his father more with large shoulders and rib cage, but still has soft facial features and hands. His complexion, hair reflexions and eye color is odd and changing from volume to volume but are generally a ghostly greyish, bluish, purplish shade except for two examples where it is white with green or brownish shadows.\n\n~!Charles was shown as man of pure and kind nature, who respects life, which was considered an unusual trait for a person who was born into a family of executioners. Subsequently, he had to endure being subjected to prejudice from society, as they saw his family as ruthless and emotionless monsters who were born to bring death and misfortune to others.\n\nWhen he was younger, he was shown to experience vomiting when in presence of dead, not being able to stomach the smell as someone from his family should. During the executions back in his younger days, due his soft nature, he was known to have mental breakdown and panic a lot, not being able to stand prejudice of people which would cause his executions to end up in more messy way then originally intended.\nLater as he became new head of family and eventually left the house of his grandmother and father, he started to change radically as he became more accustomed to pleasure and lifestyle of a playboy.!~\n\n__In the second part \"Rouge\":__\n~!Although his personality has become more closer to his father (but in more sadistic), he still possess that one side that is not necessarily completely ruthless, such as considering the pardon of sinners. As the second season progresses, he does seem to come back to his more compassionate ways, although not completely.!~\n\n(Source: Innocent Wiki)",

      "description": "Marie-Josèphe Sanson is the younger half-sister of Charles-Henri Sanson and one of the two main characters of the series. Born in 1751 to Charles Jean-Baptiste Sanson and Jeanne-Gabrielle Berger Sanson.\n\nHer looks are considered to be too unladylike as she tends to style her sun-blond hair in buzzcut and undercut styles. Usually shaving left side of her head or both sides. She even completely shaved her hair once. Despite her tomboyish appearance Marie is considered as a very beautiful young woman with blonde hair and piercing blue eyes. She has strong physical resemblance to her older brother Charles-Henri Sanson.\n\n~!Marie becomes a Prévôté de L'hôtel at the age of 11. After witnessing her successful standing decapitation of Marquis Georges de La Tour, the future Duke of Orleans Louis Philippe II takes her to Versailles to act as Prévôté de L'hôtel there.!~\n\n~!At the age of 19, Marie engages in a lesbian relationship with the Dauphin of France Marie-Antoinette, after being made her guard by Louis Philippe. After Madame du Barry shares her concerns of Marie's influence on Antoinette with Charles-Henri, he challenges Marie to a duel. Charles-Henri promises to grant her freedom if she wins and to marry her off to the man Charles and his father have approved if she loses.\n\nMarie puts all her strength in the duel, and attempts unsuccessfully to kill Charles-Henri. However, Marie is shot in the shoulder with a gun her brother snuck into the duel. Incapacitated and with Charles-Henri's sword at her heart, Marie agrees to marry, with the condition that she could wait until her hair had grown out before the ceremony was held. \n\nJust prior the wedding, Marie returns to Versailles, disguised as a proper lady, and attempts to persuade Antoinette to continue her vow not to speak with Madame du Barry, as well as the relationship the two had. However, Antoinette chooses to embrace “adulthood” and finally speaks to the king’s mistress. \n\nThe wedding is held, but Marie’s betrothed, a distant Sanson named Gaspard, does not show up. Marie begs Charles-Henri to allow to her to instead marry the nephew of Nicolas Sanson, Jean-Louis, a man she claims to love. Both Andre and Nicolas Sanson persuade Charles-Henri further, and he agrees to sign the marriage certificate. A complex plot is revealed once the marriage is official. Jean-Louis Sanson was easily swayed with gifts of food, and Marie convinced him to reinstate her position as Prévôté de L'hôtel if they married. Through the help of one of Marie’s admirers, Chevalier d’Eon, Gaspard was held captive for the duration of the wedding so Marie’s plan could work. Now as a married woman, Marie tells Charles-Henri she is no longer subordinate to her brother’s decisions as Sanson family patriarch, and returns to her position as Prévôté de L'hôtel.!~\n\n(Source: Innocent Wiki)",
