When born, a powerful [nine-tailed demon fox](https://anilist.co/character/7407) attacked his village. With a wave of its tail, the demon fox could raise tsunamis and shatter mountains. In a valiant attempt to save the village from destruction, the Fourth Hokage and leader of the Hidden Leaf Village sealed the demon fox within Naruto's newborn body. This was his final act, for the battle with the fox cost him his life.  Despite the Fourth Hokage's dying wish that Naruto is viewed as a hero for serving as the container for the demon (a  _Jinchuuriki_), the adult villagers of Konoha harbored a fierce hatred for him, with many believing that Naruto and the demons were one and the same. Cast aside as an inhuman monster, Naruto was outcast and ostracised by the villagers for reasons he could not understand. The children his age could only ever follow their parents' example; and they too came to harbor a fierce hatred for Naruto.  Naruto eventually came to accept that he would live and die alone, and his external response was to perform harmless pranks on the village. Coy, raffish, and full of life, Naruto soon came to display a somewhat unexpected determination to succeed and be accepted by others. Upon being assigned to \"Team Seven\" as a Genin-ranked ninja, his true potential soon became outwardly apparent.  Vowing to become Hokage one day and using his will to never give in, Naruto saves the village from invading forces and earns his acceptance. Eventually, Naruto learns to harness the power of the Demon Fox sealed inside him to perform acts of strength far beyond what any other human is capable of.  In all, Naruto is an admirable character whose sheer determination to succeed despite the odds, earns him respect and devotion from his fellow villagers.",

Of the ten, Anko was the only one to survive, establishing the one-in-ten chance of surviving the Cursed Seal. Orochimaru supposedly rejected Anko as a subordinate, believing she did not have the lust for power or vengeance needed to fuel the Cursed Seal. Orochimaru lost interest in her, though he believed there was some value in letting her live. In the anime, after learning of her past, she was glad to discover that she wasn&#039;t tossed away like trash as she first had thought by Orochimaru, but chose to leave Orochimaru herself.    Anko is easygoing, tomboyish, playful, stubborn, and sometimes hyperactive, making her very similar to Naruto Uzumaki in many ways.

However, she is also shown to have a bloodthirsty (in a literal sense) side, as shown when she scratched Naruto&#039;s face with a kunai, and licked away his blood. This probably comes from her time with Orochimaru. She regularly makes sure to have at least basic knowledge of the landscape for which her next mission will take place. As shown in flashbacks during the Land of Sea arc, Anko greatly admired Orochimaru while under his tutelage, seeing him as a role model and was inspired to be more like him. After being branded by Orochimaru with the Curse Seal, Anko became enraged and carried a deep loathing for her former teacher. From there on, Anko continues to search for Orochimaru in hopes of taking him down, feeling that it is her duty as his former subordinate to stop him, even at the cost of her life.",

Hinata was trained by her father, Hiashi Hyuga, to become the clan's heiress, though in time he came to deem her a lost cause. Believing her to be of lesser skill than her younger sister, Hanabi Hyuga, her father left Hinata in Kurenai Yuhi's care once she was assigned to Team 8, claiming he didn't care what happened to her. Throughout her early time in Team 8, Hinata's lack of self-confidence and unwillingness to fight hamper her abilities. Although she would train to improve her skills, she would immediately give up when faced with competition and failed every mission she was assigned as a result.  In an attempt to change herself, Hinata enters the Chunin Exams, where she is pit against her cousin, Neji Hyuga, in the exam's preliminary matches. Neji is quick to ridicule Hinata for her personality traits and attempts to convince her that she is a failure who will never be able to change herself, bringing her to tears. Naruto Uzumaki's encouragement, however, empowers her to fight her cousin despite repeatedly being struck down. Although she is defeated, Naruto's words have a lasting effect on Hinata and she becomes more confident in her abilities, and even sticks up for herself by telling Neji that he is the one who is attempting to fight against what cannot be changed. After recovering from her wounds, Hinata continues training to prove herself to her father and Naruto. Her efforts are successful in both regards, as she is eventually able to acquire a better relationship with her father, who encourages her to continue working on improving herself. Naruto has also come to hold her in a higher standing, and he tells her that while he had considered her timid and weird before, he now views her as a likable person.  Hinata has a long-standing crush on Naruto, which has been present since their time in the Academy. Her feelings for him are rooted in his determination, confidence, and strength, all of which Hinata lacks. With her affection for Naruto, Hinata is constantly willing to break away from her normal personality traits in order to help him. She also becomes more assertive for Naruto, and also doesn't hesitate to defend him, even to himself. Her feelings for Naruto are one of the driving forces in her self-improvement, as she tries to gain strength in an attempt to both impress him and become like him. When they meet again in Part II, Hinata is unable to bring herself to greet Naruto and passes out when he comes to greet her, her feelings for him having apparently been amplified during his absence. Despite this, she gradually becomes more comfortable around Naruto, going from being unable to look him in the eye to being able to talk to him, and is able to work with him without difficulty when they are on missions together.  As a member of the Hyuga clan, Hinata possesses the Byakugan, which gives her an almost 360 field of vision. During the Chunin Exams, she displays the ability to focus the Byakugan's sight, increasing the distance that her eyes can see. She also specializes in the Gentle Fist fighting style, which allows her to damage her opponent's chakra circulatory system and inner organs directly with even a slight tap. In her quest to get stronger, Hinata creates a new ability during the anime's Bikochu arc called Protection of the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms (守護八卦六十四掌, Shugohakke Rokujūyon Shō?), a combination of the Hyuga clan's most powerful techniques. With it Hinata emits streams of chakra from her palms to create extremely sharp blades that she can use to hit any target in her field of vision. Due to the speed at which these blades move, the amount of control she has over them, as well as her ability to manipulate their size, Hinata can use this technique to attack and defend simultaneously.",

Neji and Lee have somewhat of a rivalry, much like that of Guy and Kakashi Hatake. Lee is determined to prove that a \"failure\" such as himself can defeat a \"genius\" such as Neji. Neji, however, doesn't seem to be interested in this goal of Lee's, and Lee doesn't seem to have made an effort to prove the point to Neji. Despite this apparent clashing of ideals between the two, Neji seems to get along fairly well with Tenten, with the latter often helping Neji with his training. Neji and Tenten also tend to share opinions on Lee and Guy's overreactive behaviors, often wondering how they can train the way they do.  As a member of the Hyuga clan, Neji possesses the Byakugan, allowing him to see the chakra flow of others and block the flow upon contact with his Gentle Fist style. As a member of the clan's branch house, Neji can never hope to be taught how to use the clan's most secret techniques by the clan's elders. Despite this, Neji has learned many of the clan's strongest techniques independently, even creating a few unique skills of his own. Because of this, Neji is known as a genius ninja and graduated from the Academy as the #1 rookie.  Because his father, Hizashi Hyuga, was a member of a branch house of the Hyuga clan, Neji was born into the branch house. As a result, he was branded with the Hyuga branch family seal at a young age so that the members of the main house could keep him in check. Hizashi, believing Neji to be denied his potential as a branch house member, openly resented the main house, causing Neji to acquire the same feelings due to his father's influence. In time, Neji's hatred for the main house would increase exponentially as result of Hizashi being sacrificed to save the life of Hiashi Hyuga, Hizashi's twin brother. Neji believed that his father was forced to die for his twin brother. Because of this, Neji came to feel that fate was something decided at birth and that no matter what one does, people cannot escape their destiny. This idea would go on to shape Neji's life, creating a deep hatred for the main house and all of its members.   After the Chunnin Exams when Neji fights Naruto his both his great skill and potential are recognized by the clan leader, his uncle Hiashi Hyuuga, and is sought out by him to train with the main branch of the family to further enhance Neji's skills. This helps ease some of the tensions between the two branches of the Hyuuga clan.",

Sasori's parents were killed by Sakumo Hatake when he was a child, leaving him as an orphan with no one but his Grandmother to raise him. To help Sasori cope with the death of his parents, Chiyo taught him the art of puppet making. He began making puppets at the age of five, and was even able to create puppets that resembled his parents in an attempt to mend the terrible loneliness he felt. Sasori later lost interest in these puppets because they were lifeless beings unable to give him the natural parental love that he desired. Sasori was a born natural at the art, even devising masterful ways of eliminating a puppet master's weakness. Sasori was the creator of numerous masterfully crafted puppets, a number of which were used by Kankuro. Chiyo as well was a wielder of Sasori's puppets, as she was the one who retrieved the Mother and Father puppets after Sasori discarded them.!~",

Before joining the Akatsuki, Deidara was a terrorist bomber for hire. His work caught the eye of Pain, who sent other Akatsuki members to recruit him. Though he refused at first, Deidara was forced to join the organization after being defeated by Itachi Uchiha. Deidara maintained a deep loathing for Itachi from that point onward and became determined to defeat him, even training one of his eyes to overcome Itachi's signature ability: genjutsu. Deidara was partnered with Sasori upon joining the organization, who earned Deidara's admiration through his artistic ability and insight. Deidara was partnered with Tobi after Sasori's death, whom he treated as a disciple. Despite Tobi's habit of accidentally angering Deidara, Deidara took great care to keep Tobi out of harm's way and even spent his final moments apologizing to him.  In battle, Deidara uses special mouths on the palm of each hand to create Exploding Clay, chakra-infused clay that explodes on command. He commonly uses the command \"Katsu\" to trigger it. The blast strength of his creations is determined by how much chakra he adds to them. His clay can take on any size or form, ranging from microscopic in size to copies of himself as tall as a skyscraper. Deidara refers to his creations as \"art,\" believing the most beautiful thing about them to be their detonation. His admiration for his art is to such a degree that he believes it can't be defeated, leading to a feeling of overconfidence in battle. Depending on the complexity or potency of one of his works, Deidara applies it a designation that ranges anywhere between \"C1\" to \"C4\", the former being the most basic and the latter being his strongest and most complex attack. For his final act, Deidara also has a mouth on his chest that, once provided with clay, turns him into a living bomb that destroys everything within a 10 kilometer radius.",

In addition to having shark-like teeth, Suigetsu enjoys killing; Kisame Hoshigaki, one of the Seven Swordsmen, claims Suigetsu is a prodigy at the art of murder, as he has a habit of chopping off his victim's limbs before beheading them. He is also very confident in his abilities, since he has threatened Sasuke Uchiha on more than one occasion. Not afraid to speak his mind and always doing as he pleases, Suigetsu clashed with Sasuke at first, but eventually came to accept Sasuke's position and even put himself in harm's way to protect him.   After joining Hebi, Sasuke takes Suigetsu to retrieve Zabuza Momochi's giant Kubikiri Hōchō from his graveside. Suigetsu can wield the weapon with relative ease, despite its enormous size and weight. In his allegiance with Sasuke, Suigetsu hopes to acquire the sword of Kisame as well, which Karin assumes to mean that he wants to collect all of the swords of the Seven Swordsmen.  Suigetsu is able to reduce himself to liquid form and return to bodily form at will. This ability also allows him to change his body shape, giving him the ability to increase the size of his limbs, proportionally increasing his strength, if necessary. It also makes striking him somewhat difficult; since he is made of liquid, any sufficiently powerful strike will go right through his watery form. Suigetsu is the first ninja seen carrying water bottles on his outfit. Given his somewhat frequent desire to consume water, it is suggested that Suigetsu requires regular hydration to sustain his watery form.",

This is partly due to him seeking paths of least resistance, as he often chooses to do things he would otherwise not do if people nag him enough. In his free time he typically takes naps, watches clouds, and plays strategy games such as Shogi and Go. When put into a situation where he potentially needs to put effort into something, he attempts to try to find a way to avoid it such as forfeiting a battle or by pretending to be preoccupied with something else. In the instances where he can not avoid these situations, Shikamaru tends to remark \"how troublesome.\"\n\nDespite his lazy tendencies, Shikamaru is extremely intelligent. His teacher, Asuma, found Shikamaru to have an IQ of over 200, and learned that Shikamaru's poor grades were a result of him finding lifting a pencil to be too much work for him. Nevertheless, Shikamaru works very well with his teammates, as their fathers were teamed together in their youth.\n\nOne of Shikamaru's more distinctive characteristics is that he finds all women to be bossy and \"a pain.\" Contrary to this opinion, he has expressed a notably mature interest in marriage and raising a family with a son and daughter. Ironically, Shikamaru seems to constantly find himself surrounded by the very same strong-willed and bossy women he dislikes. In addition to his own mother, and being surrounded by bossy females, he usually ends up fighting against such women. Shikamaru has had a number of his appearances coincide with those of Temari. When they make their Part II debut together, Naruto Uzumaki asks if they are on a date, though both Shikamaru and Temari state that this is not the case.\n\nWhen the need arises, Shikamaru is quick to abandon his lazy nature and act appropriately to complete a mission or save his teammates. Using his Shadow Imitation Technique, the signature technique of his clan, he can capture the shadow of an opponent to either keep them immobilized or force them to mimic his movements.",

Despite his open display for his love of food, Chouji is very sensitive about his size and becomes highly agitated when somebody calls him \"fat\". Once called \"fat\", Chouji's resolve to fight is elevated to new levels and he becomes much more hostile to his opponents than he would otherwise. Just as they use food against him, Chouji's teammates use this personality trait against him as well. Should Chouji be reluctant to fight, one of them need only comment on his size to spur him into combat form.  As an Akimichi, Chouji's style of combat focuses on increasing his size.

His two team mates were Tsunade and Orochimaru. Later on, they became known as the Legendary Three Ninja, also known as \"Sannin\".\n\nJiraiya is also a full-pledged pervert. He adores good looking women and gets distracted by their sight often. He often gives the reason that he is doing research for his writing. Amongst other traits, he is a toad-tamer, with the ability to summon powerful toads at will to aid him in battle. He holds a key part in teaching and training Naruto.",
