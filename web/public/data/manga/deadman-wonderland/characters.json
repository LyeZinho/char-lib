      "description": "A mysterious albino girl that Ganta encountered during his first days as an inmate. Clothed only in a skin-tight bodysuit and muffly gloves, which conceals her heavily scarred skin, Shiro stands out among the other prisoners due to her bizarre appearance and mannerisms. To Ganta, Shiro's manner of speaking and acting remind him of a small child, even though Shiro is the same age as him. However, Shiro possesses inhuman physical abilities and has an intimate knowledge of the prison, having apparently lived there most of her life. From the beginning of the story it is made clear that, as children, Shiro and Ganta were close friends. Ganta, however, has no memories of his childhood, which greatly saddens and annoys Shiro.   ~!Despite her seemingly harmless appearance, Shiro harbors a dark secret; she possesses two personalities and her second one is the 'Red Man' Ganta is searching for, who is also the 'Wretched Egg', the source of the Branch of Sin infection. Thanks to the Mother Goose mainframe, Deadman Wonderland's supercomputer, which constantly emits a lullaby audible only to Shiro and Tamaki's father, Shiro's true personality is repressed. When the lullaby is turned off, Shiro becomes a murderous, smirking maniac capable of massacring whole squads of armed men with little effort. It's at these times that she dons a crimson colored full body restraint, which gives her a taller, masculine appearance, hence Ganta's inability to recognize her (later it's revealed that this costume was made after the 'Aceman', a superhero character in a cartoon Shiro and Ganta used to watch together as kids). Shiro cares greatly for Ganta and constantly seeks his approval. She is willing to do anything that Ganta asks her as long as it will make him happy. Even when in her 'Red Man' state, she still seems to care for him, as it was implied that she butchered Ganta's classmates just so that he would be sent to Deadman Wonderland, where she was also living. !~ (Source: Wikipedia)",

After making their way to sector G, Crow destroyed the Necro Macro security robot which had been chasing Ganta, Shiro and Yoh. After a small skirmish, and an interruption by Shiro, Crow was subdued by the Deadman security. The next day, Ganta and Senji were slated to be the next two Deadmen to compete in the \"Carnival Corpse.\" Despite Senji's experience and skill with his 'branch' ability, Ganta managed to win by fooling Senji. As a consequence for losing, Senji's right eye was removed for research. He returns a short time later during Ganta's next match, sporting an eyepatch and gives Ganta assistance with figuring out his opponent's techniques. He also helps Ganta understand his own capabilities. His change in personality toward Ganta is due to his respect for Ganta's strength. Senji comments that because Ganta beat him, he is not allowed to lose until they have a rematch.   He seems to thoroughly enjoy violence, and his favorite phrase is \"Dead Center\" (or in the dub of the anime, \"Sssslice.\"). Despite his wild and battle-hungry attitude, he does have a sense of honor and respects strength and determination. In an ironic twist, Senji becomes flustered and embarrassed when a woman acts immodest. When he first notices Shiro's form fitting body tights, his face becomes red and he give her his coat telling her to quickly cover up.   His Branch of Sin is called \"Crow Claw\". It manifests as two large scythe-like blades, made of blood, extending from long cuts on his forearms. He makes these cuts using two bladed rings he wears on his thumbs. While the blades are typically two to three feet long, Senji has demonstrated the ability to greatly lengthen them allowing him to attack people at range. He is responsible for naming Ganta's 'Branch of Sin' (Ganta Gun).  He also has a supersonic attack called Invisible Black.   Senji used to be a policeman before his time in DW. It's hinted that he killed four friends.    ~!It's revealed in his fight with a Forgery that Senji did not kill them, but was indirectly responsible for their deaths. After the Tokyo massive earthquake, chaos ruled in Seiji's inspection area, and out of the corrupt police force, only Seiji and his friends were active against the local crimes. Their actions soon drew hostile attentions of many hoodlums, especially to Seiji since the branch of sin he possessed was a powerful asset. They challenged Seiji to a many-on-one battle, but his friends stopped him and took on the offer, and ended up savagely murdered in his place. As such, he partially believes Ganta in that he did not kill his friends, because he has experienced similar circumstances  !~",

She especially likes the look of her brother blaming himself for their father's death, though he does know the real truth.

Her Branch of Sin is called \"Whip Wing\", which uses blood from her ears to create whips that can quickly strike and restrain the target.   ~!

She tried holding on to her mother to help her escape but her mom let go of her and ran away for her own life. Leaving Minatsuki behind inside the house.

He has a son, left in the care of a nursery outside, and fights for freedom to see his child.

It&#039;s later revealed that Nagi&#039;s son actually died in his mother&#039;s womb when Nagi&#039;s wife was killed. This prompted Nagi to develop a second, horrifyingly savage and inhuman personality, which slaughtered numerous Undertakers in vengeance. Genkaku is especially fascinated by this and later drugs Nagi to bring to light this side of him, which causes Nagi to temporarily revert to his second personality and attacks his own comrades. Ganta manages to bring Nagi back to his senses, but then, Genkaku fatally wounds Nagi by blasting a hole in his stomach, as he claims that he loves Nagi&#039;s dark side and will kill Nagi to bring him salvation, if he chooses to stay the person he is. However, Nagi still manages to stop Genkaku from dodging Ganta&#039;s powerful attack, which permanently incapacitates Genkaku, and dies shortly afterwards.   !~",

After the Scar Chain incident, she was sent by Makina as a spy to the Deadmen sector and was transformed into a &#039;forgery&#039;, artifical Deadman with scarcely any wills of their own, controlled by a mask they cannot take off. Ganta recognized her due to the star-shaped band-aid she put on her hand, and tried to protect her at the cost of his friendship with fellow Deadmen. Later on she teamed up with Shiro to rescue Ganta.    As a child, Azami was neglected by her parents. She joined a motorcycle gang in high school and was put in jail when she took all the blame for her friends after an accident. She keeps a pet.       ~!She later gets beheaded and dies in chapter 40 after an encounter with &quot;The Red Man&quot;.!~",
