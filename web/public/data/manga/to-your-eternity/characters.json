      "description": "**Age:** ~!~800 years!~\n**Relatives**: [The Beholder](https://anilist.co/character/136553/Kansatsusha) (\"father\"; creator), [March](https://anilist.co/character/136541/March) (adoptive \"mother\"), [Gugu](https://anilist.co/character/136554/Gugu) (adoptive brother)\n\nFushi is an immortal being created by The Beholder and placed on Earth to preserve the world.\n\nFushi is an immortal being that can take the form of anything that has given him stimuli. His original form was a featureless white sphere. Without consciousness, he copied the first thing he bumped into, which happened to be a rock. Soon afterward, he became moss and stayed like that for some time. When a wounded wolf wandered close in the middle of winter and died, the immortal copied the wolf. He retains the ability to turn into these things. Later, after the death of the [nameless boy](https://anilist.co/character/201555/Unnamed-Boy), he mimicked the boy's appearance and took the form of a young boy with white hair, a pale complexion, and green eyes. He wears a short, brown fur cloak and a light blue shirt and pants with fur boots. A rope dangled from his hand and neck as the nameless boy died holding [Joaan](https://anilist.co/character/163694/Joaan)'s leash, though the latter soon disappeared. Fushi commented on the form, saying it felt like it belonged to him the most. Other than the nameless boy (whose form he usually defaults to), he can also take the form of many others; most notably: ~!March, a little girl with long black hair wearing a simple white dress; Gugu, a young man with defined muscle who hides his face behind a salamander mask; and [Parona](https://anilist.co/character/136544/Parona), a young woman with black hair and a slender body.!~\n\nFushi appears to be a good listener, is curious, brave, and a fast learner. Before learning how to speak, Fushi would learn how to do things by mimicking other people's actions. After learning how to express himself via words, Fushi speaks his mind - no matter how mean it may sound. He cares deeply for others and dislikes death. He also blames himself for the Nokkers' attacks, believing that destruction follows wherever he goes. Fushi finds it extremely hard to make friends because he knows he will have to see their lives to the end; they will always die while he lives forever.",
