      "description": "__Sports Team:__ Basketball\n__School:__ Eimei Junior and Senior High\n__Year:__ High School Second-Year / Third-Year\n\nA first-year high school student and the rising star of Elmei Junior and Senior High's girls' basketball team. Her personality and skills have made her incredibly popular both inside and outside of her school, to the point where she's been featured in various magazines. Chinatsu can be quite competitive, as she always arrives to Elmei's gymnasium in the morning for open practice even earlier than [Taiki Inomata](https://anilist.co/character/191242/Taiki-Inomata), whom she frequently shares the floor and sometimes plays one-on-one games with. \n\nThe day after she completed her years as a junior high school student, Chinatsu tearfully practiced playing basketball, having barely failed to qualify for nationals. When Taiki reminds her both of said event and how hard she works, Chinatsu makes it her goal to go to nationals despite her family moving overseas. To get around this, she stays at Taiki's house due to their mothers being friends and former teammates. She gives Taiki a matching foot bracelet when she learns that he also plans to go to nationals.\n\nIn the _Ao no Hako_ one-shot, Chinatsu is the captain of her school's girls' basketball team.",

While not the most-talented player, Taiki is nonetheless extremely hardworking. He very routinely goes to Elmei's gymnasium for morning open practice, sharing the floor with his crush, [Chinatsu Kano](https://anilist.co/character/191241/Chinatsu-Kano). Taiki's strong work ethic is complemented by his optimistic view of things and his headstrong demeanor. His two friends, [Kyou Kasahara](https://anilist.co/character/218647/Kyo-Kasahara) and [Hina Chono](https://anilist.co/character/218648/Hina-Chono), notice that he likes to push himself beyond his own limits in order to achieve his goals, no matter how far away said goals are from him. Taiki also tends to gets ahead of himself in various situations, as his first few interactions with Chinatsu reveal.\n\nChinatsu is frequently shown to be an inspiration for Taiki, as seeing her do her best motivates him to work harder. He vows to go to nationals after learning that Chinatsu will stay at his house so that she can focus on doing the same.\n\nIn the _Ao no Hako_ oneshot, Taiki is instead a member of his school's boys' volleyball team.",
