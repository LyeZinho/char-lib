In his previous life, he was known as Hamel Dynas, and was one of the Five Great Heroes who vanquished three of the five Demon Kings of the Devildom of Helmuth long ago. After dying in the castle of the Demon King of Incarceration, he found himself reborn 300 years later as a distant relative of his comrade, Vermouth Lionheart. Reborn into a collateral branch family of the Lionheart Family, the son of Gerhard Lionheart, he swore to finish the task his comrades could not: Kill all the Demon Kings.",
