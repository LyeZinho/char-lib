  "description": "Tomie Kawakami is a femme fatale with long black hair and a beauty mark just under her left eye. She can seduce nearly any man, and drive them to murder as well, even though the victim is often Tomie herself. While one lover seeks to keep her for himself, another grows terrified of the immortal succubus. But soon they realize that no matter how many times they kill her, the world will never be free of Tomie.\n\n(Source: Viz Media)\n\nNotes:\n\n- While a collection of mainly independent short stories, Tomie was originally published as Volumes 1 and 2 of the  Ito Junji Kyofu Manga Collection. This entry is for the standalone release of Tomie first published in February 2000 with previously unreleased chapter \"小指/Little Finger\".\n\n- Later collections such as the 'Complete Deluxe edition' by Viz combines this and the sequel entry Tomie: Again for a total of 20 chapters.\n\n- The short story “Painter” has been adapted in the first part of episode 9 of Ito Junji: Collection.",
