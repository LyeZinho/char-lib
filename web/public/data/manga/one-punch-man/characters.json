      "description": "__Height:__ 175 cm (5'9\")\n\nSaitama is the main protagonist of One Punch Man, and the most powerful hero alive. Having apparently trained himself to superhuman condition, Saitama faces an existential crisis as he is now too powerful to gain any thrill from his heroic deeds.  He is registered with the Heroes Association as a B-Class Superhero and is tasked to defend Z-City against Mysterious Beings. \n\nFor a superhero, Saitama is rather laid-back. Because even the mightiest foes pose no challenge to him, he doesn't take his hero work very seriously. In spite of this, he is constantly searching for an opponent that can challenge him, since his superhero work is beginning to bore him because it's too easy. The combination of his attitude, unstoppable strength, and distinctively simple and 'unimpressive' appearance often cause his battles to become anticlimactic. Saitama will usually allow his opponents to rant about their motives and power up into their strongest forms before suddenly and nonchalantly obliterating them with one punch.",

He wears a turtleneck sweater, has sunken cheeks, a defined jawline and a squarish chin. Notably, a loud drumming sound may be heard in his proximity. The King Engine is a rumbling sound that others claim occurs when King readies for battle or when he is generally serious having an intimidating effect on his opponents. ~! In actuality, it is simply the sound of King's heartbeat which, when he is frightened, is so loud that it can be heard outside his body, but because of King's intimidating reputation people mistake it for bloodlust. King is able to appear to remain calm in threatening situations as well as put out an extremely threatening aura. Despite the intimidating personality King projects, he is actually a coward and an otaku. He has been shown to get very excited about buying a dating game. Saitama saved his life many times, but always end up getting all the credits that was supposed to be for the latter. With this misunderstanding, he came to be known as \"the strongest man on earth\".

He does not consider other human villains to be allies, wiping out a large group of them along with the heroes present. He will also attack low ranked hero and hero staff members if he encounters them. A large aspect of his personality seems to be some sort of disdain for his former master, Bang, enough to avoid using the Water Stream Rock Smashing Fist he was taught unless seriously cornered.\n\nHe has no remorse even for people who aid him, as he smashed Licenseless Rider's face soon after the latter defended him.\n\nAlthough Garou is an evil character, he possesses some kind of morality: he lets heroes live so that they can grow stronger and fight him again.\n\nIn some ways, Garou can be considered the opposite to Saitama.
