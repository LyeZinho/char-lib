  "description": "First year high schooler Junta Shiraishi is a mob character who goes unnoticed even when he's standing right next to you. But his classmate, \"heroine-level beauty\" Kubo, always notices him and is there to tease him. Anyone can become special to someone, but it might be a little too early to call these feelings \"love.\" Perhaps this story is still two-steps from being a romantic comedy--let's call it a sweet comedy where a background character becomes visible!\n\n(Source: MANGA Plus)\n\nNotes:\n\n- Includes 13 extra chapters and the pilot one-shot.\n\n- Won 19th place (2020) and 7th place (2021) in the Tsugi ni Kuru Manga Awards in the physical release category.",
