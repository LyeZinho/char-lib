He had a peaceful relationship with his family and regularly lectured Tanjiro about life.\n\nWhile he appeared calm on the outside, he showed a decent, noble aura with a quiet perception to his surroundings. According to his son, he did not like standing out or displaying his true abilities to others. However, if his family is in danger, he would not hesitate to protect them and shows no mercy towards the enemy.\n\n~!Despite not being a Demon Slayer and having a tragic disease that makes his body incredibly frail, Tanjuro was shown to be a phenomenally strong individual. He was born with a demon slayer mark on his forehead, had the ability to access the transparent world, and was constantly using the selfless state.!~",
