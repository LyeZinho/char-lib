Since he was young, Hinata trained his legs to compensate for his lack of height. He joins the Karusuno High School Volleyball team and amazes the team with his natural affinity as a spiker. Although he is a complete beginner and never had any experience playing in a volleyball team, he grows rapidly through each match.\n\n~!After graduating from high school, Hinata traveled to Brazil to gain experience by playing beach volleyball. This is when he got the name, Ninja Shoyo. Upon returning to Japan, he became a member of the MSBY Black Jackals, a Division 1 team in the V-League. He became a member of the Japan Men’s National Volleyball Team during the 2021 Olympics. Currently, that is the year 2022, he is a member of Asas São Paulo, a professional team in the Brazil Super League.!~",

Even though he isn't Karasuno's official setter anymore, he doesn't dream of giving up on playing in general. As such, he encourages himself and all of his teammates not to give up, no matter how rough the situation might be.\n\nSugawara's dedication to volleyball is clear when he decides to continue club activities even when most third years choose to retire to focus on their futures. In a meeting, his teacher asked Sugawara why he's so determined to continue playing even though he's not a starting member, and Sugawara replied that he doesn't want to have regrets in the future.\n\nHe is also quite perceptive as he noticed how Tanaka asked for the key to the gym (back during the first years' 3-on-3 match) even though he always comes in late, so Sugawara knew that something was up. He is also intelligent as he can come up with helpful tactics during the game. An example of this is when he came up with the idea of saying \"bring it\" and \"send it to me\" for Kageyama and Hinata's combo.",

His boisterous nature and crazy shenanigans can attract unwanted attention quite easily, which often bodes ill for him. Although he hardly ever worries about the consequences of his actions (and may even revert to violence in order to vent out his anger on certain occasions), he is surprisingly considerate of his friends' feelings and insecurities.\n\nYuu can be extremely impatient, excitable and impulsive. As Ryuunosuke Tanaka puts it, \"he simply gets too fired up for his own good.\" He doesn't bother to filter his words, and is therefore prone to blurting out whatever he's thinking in a loud and tactless manner. In-game, however, his attitude changes drastically: he becomes incredibly focused and serious, remaining calm and doing everything in his power to provide the support his team needs until the very end. For this reason, everyone in the volleyball club respects him greatly.",

He is often referred to as Guess Monster by other teams. He is cheerful and loud, though a bit sardonic. Tendō enjoys teasing both his teammates and opponents, usually annoying the latter. However, when he gets into the game, he becomes a different, more intimidating person, relishing the look of defeat on people's faces when they are denied. He has a high success rate with this blocking style due to his analytical skills and predictions, thus he is confident in his abilities . He also greatly values the fun aspect of volleyball.\n\n~!As an elementary student, he was called a monster for his looks also probably due to the meaning of his name (Satori refers to a Yokai) and was told he couldn't join the volleyball team by other students because of that. Using his guess block, he was able to block the spike of one of his bullies. This event made him feel happy and he continued to use his unique blocking technique to feel that way again despite much opposition until high school. Since his guess block got a lot of points, the Shiratorizawa coach let him join the team without resistance.!~",

He doesn't get riled up easily and is similar to Ushijima when it comes to his temperament; along with Ushijima, he wasn't upset about the hundred serves they had to do upon losing. He is confident in his own abilities, going up against three blockers and performing well despite being aware of the audience's disappointment that it wasn't Ushijima attacking.\n\n(Source [Haikyuu!!

He is the only player on Shiratorizawa's Boys' Volleyball Team who didn't get into the school with a sports scholarship. He took the exam to get into Shiratorizawa in hopes of being able to play with tall and strong players after watching Ushijima play in junior high. \n\n__Personality:__\nHe is respectful towards his upperclassmen but tends to bicker with Goshiki, a first year. Though he appears serious and composed, Shirabu is extremely hot-headed and gets annoyed at nearly every move his opponents pull. However, he is capable of recomposing himself quickly. He is also very studious and hardworking, spending all of his free time studying in order to pass the difficult entrance exam for Shiratorizawa. During junior high, he had good grades.\n\n(Source: [Haikyuu!! Fandom Wikia](https://haikyuu.fandom.com/wiki/Kenjir%C5%8D_Shirabu))",

He has been seen crying once. He doesn't seem to put much effort into his playing and sometimes accidentally lets a ball in; however, since he's a starting member in Shiratorizawa, his abilities shouldn't be too low. Tendō has noted that Kawanishi has an eclectic and more analytical blocking style, which the third year's a little annoyed by; Kawanishi would use guess blocking on occasions and switch back to read blocking when needed. He also won't fight any uncertain battles.\n\n(Source: Haikyuu!! Fandom Wikia)",

However, he gets flustered and emotional when he is mocked in return, such as when Kuroo brought up his ex-girlfriend.He is a cunning, manipulative person who uses a polite façade during matches to win the referee's favor; he would admit to net-touches and apologize loudly to bolster Nohebi's reputation, but use somewhat underhand tactics without the audience knowing, such as purposely spiking a ball at an opponent's face and using the referee's influence to get away with spikes that were originally out. During the match, he shows composure in analyzing the situation of the match, which is pointed out by the Nohebi coach.",
