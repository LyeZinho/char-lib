      "description": "__Height:__ 182 cm \n\nYeon-woo is the main protagonist of the Korean web Novel, Second Life Ranker. Prior to entering the tower, he served in the army and later on went to take on the revenge for his younger twin brother. Yeon-woo later reawakened as a 'Dragon Human' becoming a 'player' after receiving the powers from the pocket watch of [Jeon-woo](https://anilist.co/character/165469/JeongWoo-Cha). He continues to climb the tower taking revenge on those who betrayed his brother and killed him.\n\nHe is a hard-working and determined person who greatly cherishes his family. Yeon-Woo was different from his younger brother who did everything effortlessly. He often had to try over and over again to solve a problem, but he tried not to show the efforts he made, pretending he was doing fine. Unlike his younger brother who could be categorized as a natural genius, all his achievements all came from being a hard worker through which he was able to achieve results that are reflective of his effort.\n\nHowever, despite his rather advanced intellect and tactical genius, Yeon-Woo does indeed possess a childish side, where he was noted to possess a very bad sense of imagination when naming things and has a tendency of naming things with names usually though up by toddlers.\n\nThis is seen where he named the newborn Phoenix, \"Chirpy\" and when he obtained his Magical Dragon, he attempted to name it \"Growl\" and \"Roar\". Although initially thought to be him being insulting and condescending, it was later revealed that Yeoon genuinely did like those names despite their obvious childishness. This trait itself is seemingly shared with his niece, Sesha.\n\nLater after finding out about his niece, Sesha and his face being revealed to Brahm, Galliard, Phante and Edora, Yeon was noted to have begun becoming considerably warmer and less cynical due to finally opening up to others. Unlike before where he regarded them with a level of paranoia due to his brother's story, he has now begun to truly trust them.\n\n(Source: Second Life Ranking wiki)",

Nayu was also shown to have a positive, but hard relationship with his son, Phante, having been known to constantly train him to increase his strength and was known to mercilessly beat him during training to increase his battle prowess. He however did show to have a kind side with him, as seen where he also enjoyed teasing his son similarly to his daughter. However despite him caring for his children, Nayu was also shown to have no hesitance in intimidating them and scaring them when they begin getting out of line, as seen with how he handled his son, Jang.\n\n(Source: Second Life Ranker wiki)",
