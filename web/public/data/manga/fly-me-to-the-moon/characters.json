Not much is known about her, but what is known is that she's mysteriously cute.\n\nTsukasa has long pink hair with a clasp on the back and pink-red eyes. She wears elegant clothing and a skirt. While at home she is usually seen wearing modern clothing. During her trip to Kyoto, she wore a floral Yukata.\n\nTsukasa comes across as calm and level-headed; seemingly unsurprised by Nasa's rash and illogical actions. Despite this, she agreed to marry him and love him dearly. She gets embarrassed easily whenever Nasa proclaims his love towards her and how cute she is. She has a huge love for movies, games, and pop-culture. She has a wide range of knowledge concerning aspects of Japanese history. This includes how to handle a Katana properly and information regarding various locations and landmarks. Tsukasa talks about such things as if she had experienced them herself but never elaborates.\n\n~!Tsukasa is immortal and over 1400 years old, but maintains the appearance as a 16-year-old girl.!~\n\n(Source: Tonikaku Kawaii Wiki, edited)",
