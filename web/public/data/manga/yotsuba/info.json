You should come play with Yotsuba too!\n\n(Source: Yen Press)\n\nNotes:\n\n- Includes an interlude.\n\n- Won the Excellence Award for Manga at the Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006 and the Grand Prize of the 20th Osamu Tezuka Cultural Prize in 2016.\n\n- Was nominated for the Manga Taishō award in 2008 and for the 12th and 20th Osamu Tezuka Cultural Prize in 2008 and 2016.\n\n- Was nominated for the Eisner Award in the \"Best Publication for Kids\" category.",
